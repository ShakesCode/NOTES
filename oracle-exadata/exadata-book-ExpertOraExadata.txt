HYBRID COLUMNAR COMPRESSION
- Basic compression 
Basic compression works only with direct-path operations like 'insert-append'. 
Direct bypasses buffer-cache and stores rows above HWM.
Updates render rows to uncompress and stay so (DML unfriendly).
Makes pctfree 0 upon compression, wasting space.

- OLTP compression
Does not compress immediately - does so upon reaching a threshold.
No need for 'direct' operations.
DML permitted and benefit from compression.

- HCC Hybrid Columnar Compression
Supported on Exadata, ZFS Storage Appliance,Pillar Axiom or Oracle FS1 storage
If stored on other types of storage - smart scans cannot be used, first it has to decompress before reading

Limitations/Cautions:
Insert direct path triggers HCC - else it is columnar format (TBD - what is this 'columnar format')
Updates make rows to use row-format
Updates cause CU-level locking up to 32000 rows
