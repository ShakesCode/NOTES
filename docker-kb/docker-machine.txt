WHAT IS DOCKER-MACHINE
https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/#whats-the-difference-between-docker-engine-and-docker-machine

'docker-machine' can spin off a VM on your workstation with that VM running docker in it.
It was the only way when with older docker versions where 'docker' itself would not run on Windows or Mac natively.
Now, windows and mac can run docker direclty on them.

However, docker-machine is still useful to spin off VMs of various Linux flavors on workstations or remote hosts.
--> You can spin off a VM with docker in it, which in turn spins off containers in itself (like Drone??)
