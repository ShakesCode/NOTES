WHAT IS DOCKER-MACHINE
=======================
https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/#whats-the-difference-between-docker-engine-and-docker-machine

'docker-machine' can spin off a VM on your workstation with that VM running docker in it.
It was the only way when with older docker versions where 'docker' itself would not run on Windows or Mac natively.
Now, windows and mac can run docker direclty on them.

However, docker-machine is still useful to spin off VMs of various Linux flavors on workstations or remote hosts.
--> You can spin off a VM with docker in it, which in turn spins off containers in itself (like Drone??)

INSTALL
=======================
https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/

First install 'docker' itself

Next install docker-machine:

If you are running on macOS:

$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.12.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

If you are running on Linux:

https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/#installing-machine-directly
curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.12.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >/tmp/docker-machine &&
chmod +x /tmp/docker-machine &&
sudo cp /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

If you are running with Windows with git bash:

$ if [[ ! -d "$HOME/bin" ]]; then mkdir -p "$HOME/bin"; fi && \
curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.12.0/docker-machine-Windows-x86_64.exe > "$HOME/bin/docker-machine.exe" && \
chmod +x "$HOME/bin/docker-machine.exe"

Installing bash completion scripts
The Machine repository supplies several bash scripts that add features such as:

command completion
a function that displays the active machine in your shell prompt
a function wrapper that adds a docker-machine use subcommand to switch the active machine
To install the scripts, copy or link them into your /etc/bash_completion.d or /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d directory. To enable the docker-machine shell prompt, add $(__docker_machine_ps1) to your PS1 setting in ~/.bashrc.

PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__docker_machine_ps1)]\$ '
