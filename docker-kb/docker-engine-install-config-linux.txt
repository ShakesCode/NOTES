INSTALL
===============================
----------------
Install with yum
----------------
Log into your machine as a user with sudo or root privileges.

Make sure your existing packages are up-to-date.
$ sudo yum update

Add the yum repo.
$ sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo <<-'EOF'
[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Repository
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/7/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
EOF

Install the Docker package.
$ sudo yum install docker-engine

Enable the service.
$ sudo systemctl enable docker.service

Start the Docker daemon.
$ sudo systemctl start docker

Verify docker is installed correctly by running a test image in a container.
 $ sudo docker run --rm hello-world

 You will see the following messages:
     Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
     latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

     Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

     Hello from Docker!
     This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

     To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
      1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
      2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
      3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
         executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
      4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
         to your terminal.

     To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
      $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

     Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:

If you need to add an HTTP Proxy, set a different directory or partition for the Docker runtime files, 
or make other customizations, read our Systemd article to learn how to customize your Systemd Docker daemon options.

-----------------------
Install with the script
-----------------------
Log into your machine as a user with sudo or root privileges.

Make sure your existing packages are up-to-date.
$ sudo yum update

Run the Docker installation script.
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
This script adds the docker.repo repository and installs Docker.

Enable the service.
$ sudo systemctl enable docker.service

Start the Docker daemon.
$ sudo systemctl start docker

Verify docker is installed correctly by running a test image in a container.
$ sudo docker run hello-world

If you need to add an HTTP Proxy, set a different directory or partition for the Docker runtime files, 
or make other customizations, read our Systemd article to learn how to customize your Systemd Docker daemon options.

====================
CONFIGURE
====================

Create a group 'docker' and a user 'docker' or other with group docker.
Use that new user with docker group to run docker images.

# groupadd docker
groupadd: group 'docker' already exists

# useradd docker -g docker

$ sudo su - docker
$ which docker
/bin/docker
