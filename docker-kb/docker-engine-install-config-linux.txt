INSTALL
===============================
----------------
Install with yum
----------------
Log into your machine as a user with sudo or root privileges.

Make sure your existing packages are up-to-date.
$ sudo yum update

Add the yum repo.
$ sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo <<-'EOF'
[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Repository
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/7/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
EOF

Install the Docker package.
$ sudo yum install docker-engine

Enable the service.
$ sudo systemctl enable docker.service

Start the Docker daemon.
$ sudo systemctl start docker

Verify docker is installed correctly by running a test image in a container.
 $ sudo docker run --rm hello-world

 Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

 Digest: sha256:0256e8a36e2070f7bf2d0b0763dbabdd67798512411de4cdcf9431a1feb60fd9
 Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

 Hello from Docker!
 This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

 To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
     to your terminal.

 To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

If you need to add an HTTP Proxy, set a different directory or partition for the Docker runtime files, 
or make other customizations, read our Systemd article to learn how to customize your Systemd Docker daemon options.
