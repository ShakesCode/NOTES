Linux downloads (Ubuntu)
PostgreSQL is available in all Ubuntu versions by default. However, Ubuntu "snapshots" a specific version of PostgreSQL that is then supported throughout the lifetime of that Ubuntu version. Other versions of PostgreSQL are available through the PostgreSQL apt repository.

Included in distribution

Ubuntu includes PostgreSQL by default. To install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu, use the apt-get (or other apt-driving) command:

apt-get install postgresql-9.4
The repository contains many different packages including third party addons. The most common and important packages are (substitute the version number as required):

postgresql-client-9.4 - client libraries and client binaries
postgresql-9.4 - core database server
postgresql-contrib-9.4 - additional supplied modules
libpq-dev - libraries and headers for C language frontend development
postgresql-server-dev-9.4 - libraries and headers for C language backend development
pgadmin3 - pgAdmin III graphical administration utility
PostgreSQL Apt Repository

If the version included in your version of Ubuntu is not the one you want, you can use the PostgreSQL Apt Repository. This repository will integrate with your normal systems and patch management, and provide automatic updates for all supported versions of PostgreSQL throughout the support lifetime of PostgreSQL.

The PostgreSQL apt repository supports LTS versions of Ubuntu (12.04, 14.04 and 16.04) on amd64 and i386 architectures as well as select non-LTS versions(15.10). While not fully supported, the packages often work on other non-LTS versions as well, by using the closest LTS version available.

To use the apt repository, follow these steps:


Create the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list, and add a line for the repository
deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main
Import the repository signing key, and update the package lists
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | \
  sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
For more information about the apt repository, including answers to frequent questions, please see the apt page on the wiki.

Cross distribution packages

Generic RPM and DEB packages that provide a server-only distribution are avaliable for some 32 and 64-bit Linux distributions. 
These packages provide a single set of binaries and consistent packaging across different Linux distributions. They are designed for server installation where a GUI is not available and consistency across multiple distributions is a requirement.

Download the packages from BigSQL for all supported versions.

Note: The cross distribution packages do not fully integrate with the platform-specific packaging systems.

Interactive installer by EnterpriseDB

Download the installer certified by EnterpriseDB for all supported PostgreSQL versions.

This installer includes the PostgreSQL server, pgAdmin; a graphical tool for managing and developing your databases, 
and StackBuilder; a package manager that can be used to download and install additional PostgreSQL tools and drivers. 
Stackbuilder includes management, integration, migration, replication, geospatial, connectors and other tools.

This installer can run in graphical, command line, or silent install modes.

The installer is designed to be a straightforward, fast way to get up and running with PostgreSQL on Linux (Red Hat family 
Linux including CentOS/Fedora/Scientific/Oracle variants), Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives, Ubuntu Linux and derivatives, 
SuSE and OpenSuSE.

Advanced users can also download a tar.gz archive of the binaries, without the installer. This download is intended for users 
who wish to include PostgreSQL as part of another application installer.

Note: The installers do not integrate with platform-specific packaging systems.
