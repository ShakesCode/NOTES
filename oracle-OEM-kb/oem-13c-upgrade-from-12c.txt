- VERSIONS THAT CAN BE UPGRADED
You can upgrade only 13c Release 1(13.1.0.0), 12c Release 5 (12.1.0.5), or12c Release 4 (12.1.0.4), to 13c Release 2.

- BI PUBLISHER
If you have configured Oracle BI Publisher with 12c Release 3 (12.1.0.3), then you cannot directly upgrade to 13c Release 2. 
You must first upgrade to 12c Release 4 (12.1.0.4) or 12c Release 5 (12.1.0.5), and then upgrade to 13c Release 2.

- OUT OF PLACE UPGRADE
The upgrade operation is always an out-of-place upgrade where you see a new Oracle home for the OMS and the Management Agent. 
As a best practice, back up your old and new homes regularly.

- DB VERSION
You can upgrade only if the existing database is a database certified for 13c Release 2. 
If the existing database is not of the release that is supported for 13c Release 2, 
then upgrade it to the supported release before you start upgrading the OMS and the Management Repository.

- DB VERSION COMPATIBLE WITH 13C
12c DB

- DB UPGRADE
The upgrade approaches do NOT upgrade your existing database where the Management Repository is configured.
--> Upgrade the DB first
QUESTION 1 - CAN WE EXPORT THE SCHEMAS ON TO A NEW 12C DB AND POINT OMS TO THAT?
QUESTION 2 - IF WE UPGRADE ONTO A PDB, THEN HOW TO PROVIDE PDB'S CONNECT STRING TO OMS?
QUESTION 3 - IF WE UPGRADE AS NON-PDB DB, THEN WILL IT BE A PROBLEM?

- AGENT COMPATIBILITY
12.1.0.4 and above agents are compatible

- JAVA AND WLS
--> A preinstalled JDK or Oracle WebLogic Server is not supported from 13c Release 1 onwards.
The Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Installation Wizard installs Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7.0_80 
and Oracle WebLogic Server 12c Release 1 (12.1.3.0) by default. 

- WLS CANNOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER MIDDLEWARE PRODUCTS
You must ensure that the Oracle WebLogic Server 12c Release 1 (12.1.3.0) installed by the Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 
Installation Wizard is dedicated for Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. 
You must not have any other Oracle Fusion Middleware product installed in that Middleware home.

Enterprise Manager Cloud Control cannot coexist with any Oracle Fusion Middleware product in the same Middleware home 
because the ORACLE_COMMON property is used by both the products.
