Download from OMS 
 wget --no-check-certificate https://oem.company.com:7799/em/public_lib_download/emcli/kit/emclikit.jar
 
Set JAVA_HOME
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jre1.8.0_73

Install
Note: Directory 'emcli12cprod' indicates that it is for the 12c OMS Prod - a separate emcli is needed for every OMS on client machine
NOTE: To work with a specific OMS, configure emcli in the relevant directory, and set EMCLI_STATE_DIR to point to that directory
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar emclikit.jar -install_dir=/u01/app/oracle/emcli12cprod

Setup
$ cd /u01/app/oracle/emcli12cprod
$ ./emcli setup -url=https://oem.company.com:7799/em -dir=/u01/app/oracle/emcli12cprod -username=queryuser
next steps - TBD

  Description:
    Setup emcli to work with the EM specified by the -url argument.

    Issuing the "emcli setup" command with no arguments
    will show current OMS connection details.

  Options:
    -url
        The URL of the EM (OMS).
        Both http and https protocols are supported
        (https is recommended for security reasons).
    -username
        The EM username to be used by all subsequent emcli commands
        when contacting the OMS.
    -password
        The EM user's password.
        If this option is not specified, the user is prompted
        for the password interactively.
        Providing a password on the command line is insecure and
        should be avoided.
    -dir
        A directory where a EM CLI configuration directory will be
        created. This directory must be on a filesystem that is
        locally mounted. A warning and confirmation is issued for
        an HTTPS URL if the directory is not heuristically
        identified as such (unless -trustall is specified).
        The directory can be relative to the working directory
        where setup is called, or it may be absolute.
        This option defaults to the user's home directory.
    -localdirans
        Indicates whether the setup directory given with the -dir option
        is a local directory.
        Specify YES to indicate that the setup directory is local.
        Specify NO to indicate that the setup directory is non-local.
    -licans
        Parameter to indicate whether the license is accepted by the user.
        Specify YES to accept the license.
        Specify NO to not accept the license.
    -trustall
        Automatically accept any server certificate from the OMS,
        which results in lower security.
        Also indicates that the setup directory is local and trusted.
        Giving this flag is equivalent to -licans=YES and -localdirans=YES
    -certans
        Parameter to indicate whether the certificate needs to be trusted without
        having to prompt the user.
        Specify YES to trust the certificate.
        Specify NO to not trust the certificate.
     -nocertvalidate
         Do not validate the hostname in the SSL certificate provided by
         the OMS.
    -novalidate
        Do not authenticate the EM username against the OMS.
        Assume the given username is valid.
    -autologin
        In this mode, credentials are stored on the emcli client machine.
        If session has expired when a verb is executed, login is automatically
        performed and the verb is executed.
    -noautologin
        In this mode, credentials are not stored on the emcli client machine.
        If session has expired when a verb is executed, user has to explicitly
        run the login verb and then run the required verb. (This is the default mode)
    -noregister
        Do not register this emcli instance.
    -custom_attrib_file
        The pathname of a file containing Audit Custom Attribute values.
        This option is required when the OMS is configured
        for Audit Custom Attributes.
        The file should contain up to three lines, each containing
        the description of one custom attribute.
        Each line should be of the form:
          <attr-name>#<attr-displayname>#<isMandatory>#<attr-value>
            -- # is the field separator
            -- attr-name is the name of the attribute
            -- attr-displayname is the display name of the attribute
            -- isMandatory is 1 if the attribute is mandatory, 0 otherwise
            -- attr-value is the value of the custom attribute
         When -custom_attrib_file is not provided, the user is prompted
         to enter the values of the custom attributes.
