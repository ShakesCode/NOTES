WHAT IS REPLICATED AND WHAT IS SHARED
-------------------------------------
From Upgrade Guide section 5.1
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E73210_01/EMUPG/GUID-B7243A08-A186-4C41-A955-6A0F7EBDAA5E.htm#EMUPG-GUID-D8E6DD75-DE0B-47DE-A23A-7F386B7BFE98

- HOSTNAMES
OMSs and agents secured against an application virtual hostname
Each OMS and central agent configured using alias hostname

- REPLICATED ITEMS (software and oraInventory)
Each OMS and central agent installed on replicated storage and replicated between sites
Each OMS and central agent installations attached to inventory on replicated storage and replicated between sites

- SHARED ITEMS
Software Library and BI Publisher storage shared between OMS servers at each site and replicated between sites

- CENTRAL AGENT BEHAVIOR
Agents installed on each physical host at each site to provide monitoring of the hosts regardless of which site 
is currently the active site

- CURRENT SETUP CONSIDERATIONS IN UPGRADE (if current setup is not ha-dr)
If existing OEM 12c setup DOES NOT use replication architecture, 
--> then additional steps are necessary to make upgraded setup replicated.

-->--> From the upgrade doc section 5.1:
Environments that have already implemented Standby OMSs using Storage Replication DR architecture configured with best practices 
can make use of the standard upgrade procedures and do not require the additional steps detailed in this chapter. 

Environments that have not yet implemented the best practices for the Standby OMSs using Storage Replication DR architecture will need to be transitioned in order to support Disaster Recovery in Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c.
