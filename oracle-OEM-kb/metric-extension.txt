ORDER OF ACTIONS
> Metric Extension Menus:
Create metric extension
Make it 'deployable'
Publish it
Deploy it to targets (this does not yet create alerts)

> Incident Rule Menus:
Create incident rule (again to the specific targets) (TBD)

METRIC EXTENSIONS BEING TESTED

>> This has only one value - no key-value pair
ME$Testing_GG_Lag_Hostscript

>> These have four dummy outputs as key-value pairs

INCIDENT RULE SET - Create New


VERIFY IF METRICS ARE BEING COLLECTED

RESOLVE AND CLEAR INCIDENT IN OEM
Incident got created on Sep 15, 4:42.
Marked resolved on 16 Sep at 2:29  --> wait and see if it re-appears on next run
It seemed to clear after some time??
Also, had set the crit threshold to 500 and to run every 5 min - and ME sends only 350 - this seemed to have created a new event at 3:07 as 'warn' - marked that also as 'resolved' (it was set to 'resolved' automatically or by my other update??) - need to wait and see --> it did not clear it and new alert did not get generated - tried doing 'reevaluate' (click the event and then in incident manager' - that seemed to re-obtain metric and said 'severity has not changed' - then edited the threshold to make the CRIT threshold 100 instead of 350 (did it at around 4:18am) - need to check whether that changes severity making the alert kick in - ok, it created two emails newly after thresholds changed (and no alerts in the host homepage, but two critical alerts in incident manager of the host - both at 4:22am - and later in the home page of the host also) both emails and alerts marked critical for the two processes with 111 and 350 sec lag - but one of them was marked already 'resolved' (which is the 350 one which I had marked resolved) --> should it mark it resolved or should it be new -->??

Now, marked them as warn at 500 and crit at 1000 - did it at about 4:28 am --> wait and see

question - why does 'resolved' one is still marked resolved though we have a new one in 350?
question - when will the alert go away?  is it when next collections show it has really gone away?
