*SMTP port (for sending)
SMTP by default uses TCP port 25. The protocol for mail submission is the same, but uses port 587. (also for TLS?)
Port 2525 - this port is opened on all SiteGround servers in case port 25 is filtered (by your ISP for example) and you want to send non-encrypted emails with SMTP 
SMTP connections secured by SSL, known as SMTPS, default to port 465 (nonstandard, but sometimes used for legacy reasons).


*IMAP/S port (for receving/reading)
Port 143 - this is the default IMAP non-encrypted port
Port 993 - this is the port you need to use if you want to connect using IMAP securely
