INSTALL JAVA JDK AND EE ON WINDOWS 7

INSTALL JAVA SDK  - PRE-REQUISITE
Download Java 8 SDK
Install it per instructions
It installs under this folder: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_31
NOTE: Older JDK or JRE may be there in this folder.  Set JAVA_HOME to point to this new SDK to use it.

INSTALL EE
Download EE software: java_ee_sdk-7u1.zip from Oracle's website
It has 'glassfish' in it - unlike expected J2EE and such...!!!  THAT IS OK - it is how it is.
Install it under C:\Opt\JavaEE as follows:
Copy the downloaded zip file to that folder
Unzip the contents 
It creates a new folder 'glassfish4' under it

INSTALL ECLIPSE IDE (development environment)
<< done via catalog, but download it from vendor website and install per instructions>>
