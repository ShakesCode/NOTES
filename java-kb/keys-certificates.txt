You could instruct your end users to perform the activity of importing the StartSSL CA certificate into the Java truststore. 
Links that may help include this StartSSL forum thread (only the first 4 steps are needed to import the CA certs into a truststore), a GitHub project, and this blog post; a disclaimer - I haven't attempted using any of those and you ought to be using it at your own risk.
Or, you could initialize your application with your own truststore using the 
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path_to_truststore> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<truststore_password> 
JVM startup flags, or execute the following code before initializing SSL connections:

System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore","<path_to_truststore>");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword","<truststore_password>");
This is a viable approach only if your application is a Java SE application that does not happen to be an applet 
(or an application with similar restrictions on how the truststore is specified).

System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore","<path_to_truststore>");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword","<truststore_password>");
