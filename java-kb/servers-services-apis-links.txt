Differences between API and Web Services:  https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-web-services-and-API
    API:
    An application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, data structures, object classes and/or protocols 
    provided by libraries and/or operating system services in order to support the building of applications.
    
    Webservice:
    A Web Service is defined by the W3C as "a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction 
    over a network"
    
    Clearly, both are means of communications. The diference is that Web Service almost always involves communication over 
    network and HTTP is the most commonly used protocol. Web service also uses SOAP, REST, and XML-RPC as a means of communication.
    While an API can use any means of communication e.g. DLL files in C/C++, Jar files/ RMI in java, Interrupts 
    in Linux kernel API etc. 
    
    So, you can say that-
    
    1. Web Service is an API wrapped in HTTP.
    2. All Web Services are API but APIs are not Web Services.
    3. Web Service might not perform all the operations that an API would perform.
    4. A Web Service needs a network while an API doesn't need a network for its operation.

--> Copied the code and compile seems fine
--> Issue: Could not test as telnet is not enabled on the laptop
--> Issue: The socket/service keeps being open - how to close it?
