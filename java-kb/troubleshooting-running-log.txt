Eclipse runnable jar file creation - picks up incorrect launch configuration:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18218704/cant-create-a-runnable-jar-file-via-eclipse
  Either run the project once to automatically create a run configuration or go into the project options and create one manually.
  
  Try creating a new launch configuration from scratch:
  Run -> Run Configurations...
  Right click "Java Application" in the list on the left and select "New"
  On the right enter a descriptive name.
  In the Main tab browse for your project and search for and select the appropriate main class.
  Close the dialog
  Now try exporting your runnable JAR again using that run configuration.
