=====================================
INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION BASICS
=====================================

----
JDK (Install from  application catalog or download from Oracle)
----
Installs into C:/Program Files ...

--------
J2EE SDK (download from  Oracle - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/java-ee-sdk-7-downloads-1956236.html)
--------
Install into C:\opt\J2EE-sdk

-----------
Eclipse IDE (Luna or other version - download from https://eclipse.org/downloads/)
-----------
Install steps - TBD

After install, to add Tomcat server and JRE/JDK etc to Eclipse, follow the doc eclipse-j2ee-tomcat-maven-webapp-setup.txt

-------------
Apache Tomcat (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi)
-------------
Refer: 
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/RUNNING.txt
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html#Windows
Enable https: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/09/ssl-for-tomcat-server/

(For full configuration, there may be another doc in this repository)

Extract zip file into C:\Opt\Tomcat\v8.0.32
Server 'catalina' will be in the 'bin' directory uner it.

Locate startup.bat in :\Opt\Tomcat\v8.0.32\bin

Edit startup.bat (windows) (or startup.sh (unix)):
  Windows:
  Add this line and save (use the right JRE path) -
  set "JRE_HOME=%ProgramFiles%\Java\jre7"
  
Start tomcat:
C:\ startup.bat
This will startup the job in foreground  (doc says it should start as a service - but, to start as service run service.bat)

If you dont have local admin rights on your machine, it may pop up a screen saying some features will be not enabled, 
to enable asks for admin password etc - you can uncheck/ignore/cancel that.
(Not sure what we miss because of that)

Test:
In browser, run http://localhost:8080/
You should see the Tomcat welcome page.

HTTPS is not enabled yet
To enable:  http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/09/ssl-for-tomcat-server/

Default page is C:\Opt\Tomcat\v8.0.32\webapps\ROOT\index.jsp 
--> this can be changed later as follows:
    In the same folder create an index.html
    OR replace this index.jsp with your own index.jsp
    
Admin/manager user and password:
http://www.mkyong.com/tomcat/tomcat-default-administrator-password/
$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml is to store the user and password for Tomcat admin user.
Initially no admin user/pass is stored in it
Add the following lines and restart Tomcat:

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui"/>
