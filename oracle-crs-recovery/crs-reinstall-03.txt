Before deconfiguring, collect the following as grid user  to generate a list of user resources to be added back to the cluster after reconfigure finishes:

 $GRID_HOME/bin/crsctl stat res -t
 $GRID_HOME/bin/crsctl stat res -p
 $GRID_HOME/bin/crsctl query css votedisk
 $GRID_HOME/bin/ocrcheck
 $GRID_HOME/bin/oifcfg getif
 $GRID_HOME/bin/srvctl config nodeapps -a
 $GRID_HOME/bin/srvctl config scan
 $GRID_HOME/bin/srvctl config asm -a
 $GRID_HOME/bin/srvctl config listener -l <listener-name> -a
 $DB_HOME/bin/srvctl config database -d <dbname> -a
 $DB_HOME/bin/srvctl config service -d <dbname> -s <service-name> -v
To Deconfigure
If OCR and Voting Disks are NOT on ASM, or If OCR and Voting Disks are on ASM but there’s NO user data in OCR/Voting Disk ASM diskgroup:
On all nodes except master node, as root execute:

# <$GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose
Below is the output

deconfig_rac1
Once the above command finishes on all remote nodes, on local node, as root execute:

# <$GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose -lastnode
Below is the output

deconfig_rac2

If OCR or Voting Disks are on ASM and there is user data in OCR/Voting Disk ASM diskgroup:
If GI version is 11.2.0.3 AND fix for bug 13058611 and bug 13001955 has been applied, or GI version is 11.2.0.3.2 GI PSU (includes both fixes) or higher:
On all nodes except master node, as root execute:

# <$GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose
Once the above command finishes on all remote nodes, on local node, as root execute:

# <$GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose -keepdg -lastnode
If fix for bug 13058611 and bug 13001955 has NOT been applied:

On all nodes, as root execute:
# <$GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose

To reconfigure:
For 11.2.0.1 – deinstall and reinstall with OCR/Voting Disk on a new ASM diskgroup or supported cluster/network filesystem

For 11.2.0.2 and onward – run $GRID_HOME/crs/config/config.sh and place OCR/Voting Disk on a new ASM diskgroup or support cluster/network filesystem.
