APPLIES TO:

Oracle Database - Enterprise Edition - Version 10.1.0.2 to 11.1.0.7 [Release 10.1 to 11.1]
Microsoft Windows x64 (64-bit)
Microsoft Windows (32-bit)
Oracle Server Enterprise Edition - Version: 10.1.0.2 to 11.1.0.7


GOAL

This document presents a step by step approach to reinitialize the OCR and Vote Disks without performing a full reinstallation of the 10gR2 or 11Gr1 Oracle Clusterware binaries on Windows platforms. 

Note that the procedure in this document is only useful in cases where the Oracle Clusterware Services (including:  OracleCSService, OracleEVMService, OracleCRService are intact). If any of these services are missing (such as in the case during a failed upgrade attempt to a higher clusterware version), Oracle Clusterware reinstall will be required.
 

These steps may be necessary in the following scenarios: 

1.  To troubleshoot an installation where the Cluster Configuration Assistant (which calls crssetup.config.bat ) has errored out

OR

2.  For a cluster that was running fine, but the OCR and/or Vote disks have become damaged or unusable

 

SOLUTION

Note:  If you have a OracleCRSToken service configured in this environment, it is advised to remove that service before implementing these steps, then recreate that service once these steps have been completed.  Knowledge Document Note 338000.1 explains OracleCRSToken services including how and why to create them and how to delete them.


1.  Stop all CRS managed resources 

Ensure all CRS resources are stopped using the 'crs_stat -t' utility to check the status and the "srvctl" utility to stop as required.

In particular before step 2 below make sure that you stop nodeapps.
 srvctl stop nodeapps -n <nodename>
 

Note: Failure to stop the nodeapps with the above command will result in an error since just stopping the services (as per step 2) does not stop the ons.exe and that will prevent the crssetup.config.bat script from running.


2.  Stop all CRS services 

Stop all services running from the CRS home and set them to MANUAL from the Windows Services panel:

Stop OracleCRService and set to "Manual"on ALL nodes
Stop OracleEVMService and set to "Manual"on ALL nodes
Stop OracleCSService and set to "Manual" on ALL nodes
Stop OracleClusterVolumeService and set to "Manual" on ALL nodes
Stop Oracle Object Service and set to "Manual" on ALL nodes
Stop Oracle Process Manager Service and set to "Manual" on ALL nodes
 

3.  Reformat ALL partitions for OCR and voting disk files 

All partitions that you will reuse for OCR and voting disk information should be reformatted in preparation for their recreation.

Example where OCR and Voting disks are stored on RAW partitions: 
a.  invoke the guioracleobjmanager.exe utility from $CRS_HOME\bin and note the assigned symbolic link names for ALL of the configured OCR and Voting disk partitions, example:

b.
-  Go to a command prompt
-  navigate to $CRS_HOME\bin
-  run logpartformat /q <link name as shown to you in guioracleobjmanager tool>
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>logpartformat /q \\.\ocrcfg
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>logpartformat /q \\.\votedsk1
 

Example where OCR and Voting disks are stored on OCFS partition(s):
a.  to locate your ocr partition(s) look to the following key by invoking 'regedit'
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Oracle\ocr\ocrconfig_loc
b.  to locate your voting disk partition(s), use the following command:
$CRS_HOME\bin> crsctl query css votedisk 
c.  create backups of the existing ocr and voting disk files AND create new 'placeholder' files for the replacement ocr and voting disk files
Example:
Rename O:\cdata\clustername\votedsk to O:\cdata\clustername\votedsk.old
Rename O:\cdata\clustername\ocrcfg to O:\cdata\clustername\ocrcfg.old
notepad O:\cdata\clustername\votedsk  <=== depending on how the crssetup.config.bat script is populated, this may actually be a folder and not a filename
notepad O:\cdata\clustername\ocrcfg
d.
- Go to a command prompt
- navigate to $CRS_HOME\bin
- run logpartformat /q <drive letter to OCFS partition>
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>logpartformat /q F:
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>logpartformat /q G:
 

4.  Set TEMP and TMP variables

Open a Windows command prompt and set TEMP and TMP to use c:\temp

set temp=c:\temp 
set tmp=c:\temp

5.  Start the OracleObjectService (if using RAW partitions) and/or OracleClusterVolumeService (if using OCFS partitions) on all nodes

 

Note:  As a guide for Steps 6-9 utilize the commands listed in: 

$CRS_HOME\cfgtoollogs\configtoolallcommands 
OR
$CRS_HOME\cfgtoollogs\configtoolallcommands.bak

Whichever is correctly populated for your environment.
 

6.   Locate the crssetup.config.bat script

From node1 (or whichever node was used to apply the latest patchset to this cluster), locate the crssetup.config.bat script, check that the contents of this .bat file are correct for your environment, and execute this file.

 Example:  assuming your CRS_HOME is e:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs

cd e:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\install

OR

if you have already applied a patchset:

Example: 
e:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\install\prepatch10204\install

Again, execute whichever crssetup.config.bat script is correctly populated for your environment.


E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\install\prepatch10204\install>crssetup.config.bat
Step 1:  checking status of CRS cluster
Step 2:  creating directories (E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs)
Step 3:  configuring OCR repository
Successfully accumulated necessary OCR keys.
Using ports: CSS=49895 CRS=49896 EVMC=49898 and EVMR=49897.
node <nodenumber>: <nodename> <private interconnect name> <hostname>
node 1: racnode1 racnode1-p racnode1
node 2: racnode2 racnode2-p racnode2
Creating OCR keys for user 'administrator', privgrp ''..
Operation successful.
Now formatting voting device: \\.\votedsk1
Format of 1 voting devices complete.
Step 4:  configuring safe mode for CRS stack
Step 5:  Starting up CRS stack on all nodes
Successfully completed configuration of 2 nodes

Optionally - perform a check to confirm the CRS version as per the OCR file as follows:

E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>crsctl query crs softwareversion
Oracle Clusterware version on node [racnode1] is [10.2.0.4.0]

E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>crsctl query crs activeversion
Oracle Clusterware active version on the cluster is [10.2.0.4.0]


It is important that this step be executed while logged on as the OS user account that you have selected to be the owner of the CRS installation.   In most cases, this will be the same account that did the original installation.   

If you are attempting to change the OCR to run under a different account, you must ensure that you are logged on to the OS under that new account prior to running crssetup.config.bat.  This step will create the OCR and set permissions on certain resources for the account that runs the crssetup.config.bat command.   If that OS user account is deleted in the future, or if that account's access permissions change, then the steps in this note will need to be re-run under a valid user account.  Therefore, using temporary accounts for the installation of CRS should be avoided where possible.
Upon completion of this step, Oracle Clusterware services should have started automatically.
 
7.  Execute racgons from $CRS_HOME\bin

This step configures / ensures that all nodes are configured with the same port for the ONS


racgons.exe add_config <node1>:<port#> <node2>:<port#>
Example:
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>racgons.exe add_config racnode1:6200 racnode2:6200
8.  Run oifcfg to configure public and cluster_interconnect

Example: as oracle user:

oifcfg setif -global <if_name>/<subnet>:public
oifcfg setif -global <if_name>/<subnet>:cluster_interconnect

Example:
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>oifcfg.exe setif -global "Public"/10.143.137.0:public "Private"/10.10.10.0:cluster_interconnect
9.  Run  Virtual IP Configuration Assistant (VIPCA) 

VIPCA must be run to recreate the nodeapp resources:

a.  to use VIPCA in GUI mode simply type:  'vipca' at the $CRS_HOME\bin prompt
OR
b.  to run VIPCA in silent mode, use the command as listed in the configtoolallcommands file
Example:
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs/bin/vipca.bat -silent -nodelist "racnode1,racnode2" -nodevips
"racnode1/racnode1-vip/255.255.255.0/Public,racnode2/racnode2-vip/255.255.255.0/Public"

Creating VIP application resource on (2) nodes...
Creating GSD application resource on (2) nodes...
Creating ONS application resource on (2) nodes...
Starting VIP application resource on (2) nodes...
Starting GSD application resource on (2) nodes...
Starting ONS application resource on (2) nodes...


Done.
Once this step is complete, the output of 'crs_stat -t' should show vip, ons, and gsd resources for all nodes.
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>crs_stat -t
Name             Type        Target State  Host
------------------------------------------------------------
ora.racnode1.gsd application ONLINE ONLINE racnode1

ora.racnode1.vip application ONLINE ONLINE racnode1
ora.racnode2.gsd application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
ora.racnode2.ons application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
ora.racnode2.vip application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
10.  Run Cluster Verification Uitility (cluvfy)

Run Cluster Verification Uitility (cluvfy) to confirm post crs installation

cluvfy.bat stage -post crsinst -n "<node1>,<node2>"

Example:

E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs/bin/cluvfy.bat stage -post crsinst -n "racnode1,racnode2"

Post-check for cluster services setup was successful.
11.  Create an export copy of the OCR file

 ocrconfig -export c:\tmp\ocrdump_base.out
12.  Check for Oracle Process Manager 

Ensure the "Oracle Process Manager" service is set to "Automatic" on ALL nodes
   
Oracle Support highly recommends configuring Oracle Process Manager (OPMD) to run in all Windows RAC environments.  Reference Note 358156.1 for full details.

13.  Reboot all nodes in the cluster, if possible. 

A reboot of all nodes will ensure that the clusterware services (including Oracle Process Manager service) are working as expected. 


14.  Run netca to create listener

a. rename $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora
(ASM HOME and/or RDBMS ORACLE_HOME) to any other name on all nodes
AND

b. From the command prompt, invoke netca from the ASM and/or RDBMS home (on just one node)
E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\db_1\bin\netca

Note:
Be sure to select 'Cluster Configuration' and to create a listener with the default name LISTENER

It is necessary to recreate the listener using NETCA at this point, as that is the only way to furnish the reinitialized OCR with .lsnr resource information.

Once these steps are completed, 'crs_stat -t' should show a '.lsnr' resource for all nodes

E:\oracle\product\10.2.0\crs\BIN>crs_stat -t
Name             Type        Target State  Host
------------------------------------------------------------
ora....E1.lsnr   application ONLINE ONLINE racnode1
ora.racnode1.gsd application ONLINE ONLINE racnode1
ora.racnode1.ons application ONLINE ONLINE racnode1
ora.racnode1.vip application ONLINE ONLINE racnode1
ora....E2.lsnr   application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
ora.racnode2.gsd application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
ora.racnode2.ons application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
ora.racnode2.vip application ONLINE ONLINE racnode2
15.  Recreate all necessary CRS managed resources

Run the 'srvctl add' command to add asm, database, instance and services resources back into the OCR

For full syntax usage, please execute:
 srvctl add asm -h
 srvctl add database -h
 srvctl add instance -h
 srvctl add service -h (if needed)

For example: as oracle user:
srvctl add asm -n <node_name> -i <asm_inst_name> -o <oracle_home>
srvctl add database -d <db_name> -o <oracle_home>
srvctl add instance -d <db_name> -i <inst_name> -n <node_name>
srvctl modify instance -d <db_name> -i <inst_name> -s <asm_name>

*** srvctl modify instance -d racdb -i racdb3 -s asm3 ***

<== repeat as needed to make the database instance resources dependent on their corresponding ASM instance resources in the OCR

Please note, assuming that you are using ASM the asm_inst_name can only be +ASM1, +ASM2 and so on. 
Failure in providing the correct name could cause an OCR corruption.


16.  Start all CRS managed resources

Once all necessary resources have been registered, start them via srvctl commands

For example: as oracle user:
 srvctl start asm -n <node_name>
 srvctl start instance -d <db_name> -i <inst_name>

17.  Run crs_stat -t

Check 'crs_stat -t' output, it should show all resources with TARGET and STATUS of ONLINE for all resources on ALL nodes
