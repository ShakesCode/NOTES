TRIGGER (main one for JDBC connect time failover) 
- JDBC/thin Application Fails to Connect with ORA-01033 after Dataguard Switchover (Doc ID 2129131.1)
=================================================================

Only run the database service for the primary database. The service for the standby database should be stopped.
This configuration can be automated using AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE triggers.

for example:

The database on host1 could be configured with the following trigger:

CREATE TRIGGER CHECK_SERV1_START AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE
DECLARE
V_ROLE VARCHAR(30);
BEGIN
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE INTO V_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;
IF V_ROLE = 'PRIMARY' THEN
DBMS_SERVICE.START_SERVICE('SERV1);
ELSE
DBMS_SERVICE.STOP_SERVICE(SERV1');
END IF;
END;
/
 

The database on host2 could be configured with the following trigger:

CREATE TRIGGER CHECK_SERV2_START AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE
DECLARE
V_ROLE VARCHAR(30);
BEGIN
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE INTO V_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;
IF V_ROLE = 'PRIMARY' THEN
DBMS_SERVICE.START_SERVICE('SERV2);
ELSE
DBMS_SERVICE.STOP_SERVICE(SERV2');
END IF;
END;
/

NOTE: KEY POINTS:
1. There should be only one DESCRIPTION - not DESCRIPTION_LIST
2. There should be only one service name
3. The service should be up on primary only

Net service name has LOAD_BALANCE set in description section

  (DESCRIPTION = 
    (LOAD_BALANCE = yes) 
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = NodeA)(PORT = 1521)) 
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = NodeB)(PORT = 1521))
Or has two description sections

  (DESCRIPTION_LIST = 
    (DESCRIPTION = 
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(Host = NodeA)(Port = 1521)) 
      (CONNECT_DATA = 
        (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL1) 
      ) 
    ) 
    (DESCRIPTION = 
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(Host = NodeB)(Port = 1521)) 
      (CONNECT_DATA = 
        (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL2)
CAUSE

Error ORA-1033 is expected for connections when they attempt to connect to standby instance, because it is mounted and not open.

When LOAD_BALANCE is set, connections can load balance between the addresses in the net service name.

When there are two description sections in a net service name, Oracle Net will load balance between them.

SOLUTION

Example is for service called failover 

1. Setup the net service name, ensuring LOAD_BALANCE is not used and one has one description section.

 DGtest =  
  (DESCRIPTION =  
    (ADDRESS_LIST =  
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = NodeA)(PORT = 1521))  
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = NodeB)(PORT = 1521))  
    )  
    (CONNECT_DATA =  
      (SERVICE_NAME = failover)  
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)  
        (FAILOVER_MODE =  
          (TYPE = session)  
          (METHOD = BASIC)  
          (RETRIES = 180)  
          (DELAY = 5)  
        )  
      )  
    ) 
2. Create and start service

SQL> exec DBMS_SERVICE.CREATE_SERVICE (service_name => 'failover',network_name => 'failover',aq_ha_notifications => true,failover_method => 'BASIC', failover_type => 'SELECT',failover_retries => 180,failover_delay => 1);

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.


SQL>exec dbms_service.start_service('failover');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
3.Create a database trigger to ensure the service name is always the same, no matter which node's instance is the primary.

sqlplus / as sysdba

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER manage_OCIservice 
after startup on database 
DECLARE 
role VARCHAR(30); 
BEGIN 
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE INTO role FROM V$DATABASE; 
IF role = 'PRIMARY' THEN 
DBMS_SERVICE.START_SERVICE('failover'); 
ELSE 
DBMS_SERVICE.STOP_SERVICE('failover'); 
END IF; 
END; 

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
4. Ensure the change is made on the standby with command.

SQL> Alter system archive log current ;
5. Listener service command lsnrctl services on primary will then show

Service "failover" has 1 instance(s). 
  Instance "tom1", status READY, has 1 handler(s) for this service... 
    Handler(s): 
      "DEDICATED" established:0 refused:0 state:ready 
         LOCAL SERVER

This method ensures the service failover is only available on the primary node.The net service name DGtest works through the addresses in the address_list section, in order. If NodeA is the standby, then Node B will have the service failover and the connection will attempt to connect.

JDBC/thin Application Fails to Connect with ORA-01033 after Dataguard Switchover (Doc ID 2129131.1)	To BottomTo Bottom

This document is being delivered to you via Oracle Support's Rapid Visibility (RaV) process and therefore has not been subject to an independent technical review.
APPLIES TO:

JDBC - Version 12.1.0.2.0 and later
Information in this document applies to any platform.
SYMPTOMS

A JDBC/thin application connecting to a Dataguard configuration uses the following connect string:

jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION = (LOAD_BALANCE = no)(FAILOVER = yes)(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = host1)(PORT = 1521))(CONNECT_DATA =(SERVER = DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME = serv1))(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = host2)(PORT = 1521))(CONNECT_DATA =(SERVER = DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME = serv2)))
In the initial configuration, host1 and serv1 represent the primary host and database service and host2 and serv2 represent the standby host and database service.

At this stage the JDBC connection works fine and connects to the primary database.

After the switchover is completed the 2 databases are now reversed.  Host2 and serv2 are the primary  and host1 and serv1 are the standby.

The JDBC/thin application can no longer connect due to error: ORA-01033: ORACLE initialization or shutdown in progress

It should be noted that the SQL*Plus connection still works:

sqlplus system/password@(DESCRIPTION = (LOAD_BALANCE = no)(FAILOVER = yes)(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = host1)(PORT = 1521))(CONNECT_DATA =(SERVER = DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME = serv1))(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = host2)(PORT = 1521))(CONNECT_DATA =(SERVER = DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME = serv2)))

CHANGES

 The issue is triggered by the Dataguard switchover.  During this process, the first database, which was the primary and the second database which was the standby will swap roles.

After the switchover the second database is now the primary and is in OPEN READ WRITE mode.  The first database is now the standby and is in MOUNT mode.

CAUSE

Following the Dataguard switchover, both the primary and standby database services are started.
The JDBC driver will keep trying to connect to the first database on the connect string list and hit the ORA-1033 for the standby database with is in MOUNT mode.

This is JDBC/thin specific and not reproducible with SQL*Plus apparently because the Oracle Net is configured with TAF which will ensure that only the primary database is used. 

 

SOLUTION

Only run the database service for the primary database. The service for the standby database should be stopped.
This configuration can be automated using AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE triggers.

for example:

The database on host1 could be configured with the following trigger:

CREATE TRIGGER CHECK_SERV1_START AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE
DECLARE
V_ROLE VARCHAR(30);
BEGIN
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE INTO V_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;
IF V_ROLE = 'PRIMARY' THEN
DBMS_SERVICE.START_SERVICE('SERV1);
ELSE
DBMS_SERVICE.STOP_SERVICE(SERV1');
END IF;
END;
/
 

The database on host2 could be configured with the following trigger:

CREATE TRIGGER CHECK_SERV2_START AFTER STARTUP ON DATABASE
DECLARE
V_ROLE VARCHAR(30);
BEGIN
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE INTO V_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;
IF V_ROLE = 'PRIMARY' THEN
DBMS_SERVICE.START_SERVICE('SERV2);
ELSE
DBMS_SERVICE.STOP_SERVICE(SERV2');
END IF;
END;
