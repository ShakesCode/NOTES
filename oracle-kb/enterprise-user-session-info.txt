Information in this document applies to any platform.
GOAL

The sessions created by Enterprise Users do not have the name of the external user in v$session. This note presents a method to populate one of v$session's columns with this information.

SOLUTION


Create the following logon trigger to populates enterprise user session information in V$SESSION.

create or replace trigger sys.on_logon after logon on database 
declare 
v_externalname varchar2(64) := ''; 
begin 
SELECT substr(sys_context('userenv','enterprise_identity'),1,63) into v_externalname FROM dual; 
if v_externalname is not null 
then 
DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO (v_externalname ); 
end if; 
end; 
/

After creating the LOGON Trigger you can get the enterprise user session information from client_info of V$SESSION.

How to Identify users using a shared global schema in Enterprise User Security

So we are setting up Oracle Enterprise User Security using a global schema. One question that arises if I have ten users that  are using the global schema to sign on and run queries in a database.  If lets say ten users are running ten queries and one is bad. How do I tell which user it is? If the global schema is READONLY. When looking at the v$session table they will show the user as READONLY. How can I find out it is testuser1 or testuser2?

Hi,
I think the only way to get this information is to audit on connect ("audit connect") and then joining v$session and and dba_audit_trail to find the information. I haven't heard of any other way.

 Hello,
 
you have the below options to identify enterprise user account.

1.Enable auditing for the enterprise user.If the auditing is enabled for the enterprise user then the comment_text column of AUD$ table shows the DN of the user connected to database. 


2.Create the below logon trigger to populates enterprise user session information in V$SESSION. 
create or replace trigger sys.on_logon after logon on database 
declare 
v_externalname varchar2(64) := ''; 
begin 
SELECT substr(sys_context('userenv','external_name'),1,63) into v_externalname FROM dual; 
if v_externalname is not null 
then 
DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO (v_externalname ); 
end if; 
end; 
/ 
After creating the LOGON Trigger you can get the enterprise user session information from client_info of V$SESSION.
