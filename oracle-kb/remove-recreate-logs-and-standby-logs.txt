Renaming/Dropping and recreating online redo logs and Standby logfiles

Posted by dbakalyan on April 29, 2013

We are in process of testing Dataguard with Physical standby.
After we created Primary and Standby DB’s we realize what we haven’t put file names as per our standard.
So I got the task to rename both, online redo logs and standby logs. This what I did :

1. Following is the script to identify all log files we have
SELECT GROUP#, BYTES, ‘ONLINE’ AS TYPE FROM V$LOG
UNION
SELECT GROUP#, BYTES, ‘STANDBY’ AS TYPE FROM V$STANDBY_LOG
ORDER BY 1;

2. Make sure protection mode is MAXPERFORMANCE:
SELECT PROTECTION_MODE, PROTECTION_LEVEL, DATABASE_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE

First we start working on Standby database

3. STOP redo apply
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;

4. Set STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT to MANUAL.
ALTER SYSTEM SET STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT=’MANUAL’;

5. Gather current status of all member.
SQL> select member from v$logfile;

6. Prepare command to drop standby redo logfiles.
select ‘alter database drop standby logfile group ‘ group# ‘;’ from v$standby_log;

7. Prepare command to drop online redo logfiles.
select ‘alter database drop logfile group ‘ group# ‘;’ from v$log;

8. Check the status of online redolog group.
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG;

GROUP# STATUS
———- —————-
1 CLEARING_CURRENT
3 CLEARING
2 CLEARING
We can not drop CLEARING_CURRENT status logs, for that you have sync with Primary

(Easy way is, leave them for a while and move ahead with droping Primary Database redo logs, and come back to Standby and you will be able to do it).

9. Clear the log group first before drop.
ALTER DATABASE CLEAR LOGFILE GROUP 1;

10. Now drop online redo log.
alter database drop logfile group 1;
Follow the same process for rest of the groups.

11. Now drop standby redo logs, leave the one which refuses to drop.
alter database drop standby logfile group 5;

12. Now create new online redo logs.
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE GROUP 1 ‘/path/redo_01.dbf’ SIZE 10M;

13. Now we will crate standby redo logs.
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE ‘/path/redo_std_by_05.dbf’ SIZE 10M REUSE;

14. Again check the current status of member.
select member from v$logfile;

Now you will see latest updated names for all files.
The one which left we can do them after We are done with Primary DB.

Now on Primary Database:

15. Follow step 5,6,7 to know current status and prepare commands.

16. Drop Standby redo logs and recreate them
alter database drop standby logfile group 5;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE ‘/path/redo_std_by_05.dbf’ SIZE 10M REUSE;

17. Drop online Redo logs, recrate, switch and drop next inactive one.
alter database drop logfile group 1;
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE GROUP 1 ‘/path/redo_01.dbf’ SIZE 10M;
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG;
18. Check the new status.
select member from v$logfile;

Now come back to Standby Database back and drop recreate left over online and standby redo logs.

19. Set STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT to AUTO.
ALTER SYSTEM SET STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT=’AUTO’;

20. start redo apply.
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

21. Check the status of applied log again.
select sequence#, applied from v$archived_log;
