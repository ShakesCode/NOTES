CAPTURE AUTOMATICALLY
---
Set to capture baselines: OPTIMIZER_CAPTURE_SQL_PLAN_BASELINES = TRUE
Set to use baselines:     OPTIMIZER_USE_SQL_PLAN_BASELINES = TRUE

Captures the first executed plan as 'accepted' and stores others are 'unaccepted' (meaning 'not yet accepted')

---
CAPTURE MANUALLY
---
User-initiated bulk load of existing plans into a SQL plan baseline. 
Use OEM or PL/SQL to load the execution plans for SQL statements from a SQL tuning set (STS), 
    the shared SQL area, a staging table, or a stored outline.

All manually loaded plans are marked 'accepted'.

FIXED PLAN (TBD)

---
PLAN EVOLUTION
---

DBMS_SPM package provides procedures and functions for plan evolution. 
CREATE_EVOLVE_TASK creates an evolution task, whereas EXECUTE_EVOLVE_TASK executes it. 

The automatic maintenance task SYS_AUTO_SPM_EVOLVE_TASK executes daily in the scheduled maintenance window. 
  Selects and ranks unaccepted plans for verification
  Accepts each plan if it satisfies the performance threshold
