  There are two ways to deal with this problem:
  
  Increase the distributed_lock_timeout value hoping that the session holding the lock releases it before the timeout.
  Code the application to capture this ORA error and then issue a TRY AGAIN directive.
  Another workaround would be to add more COMMIT’s as they tend to reset the distributed transaction.
  Identifying the Root Cause:
  
  To identify the session holding the resources, what oracle suggests is to dump a system state trace BEFORE the ORA-02049
  occurs.
  
  However, I have devised another approach based on oracle’s original suggestion. The basic idea will be to monitor v$session 
  for sessions waiting on the event ‘enq: TX – row lock contention’. If the seconds_in_wait value for such sessions approaches 
  the distributed_lock_timeout value and the session is involved in a distributed transaction we can find the session holding 
  the lock by joining v$lock and v$session.
