CREATE TUNING SET
====================
Choose the DB or cluster DB
Choose Performance -> SQL --> Tuning Sets

Step1:
Give the owner as one that has necessary privilege (SYS will do too)
Give a name to the tuning set

Step2:
For specific awr snapshot based set - Choose Load SQLs one time only --> AWR snapshots --> lasat 24 hrs or other

Step3:
Total number of SQL statements (leave as all or change)
Apply any filters

====================
RUN SPA
====================
Choose the database or 'cluster database' (if RAC)
Choose from dropdown 'performance' --> Advisor Home
  In the ensuing page choose "sql performance analyzer" home page ( you will see Advisor Central  >   Select Instances)
Choose the instance 1

You will see the following choices:

  SQL Performance Analyzer Workflows 
  Create and execute SQL Performance Analyzer Task experiments of different types using the following links.
  Upgrade from 9i or 10.1 Test and analyze the effects of database upgrade from 9i or 10.1 on SQL Tuning Set performance. 
  Upgrade from 10.2 or higher releases Test and analyze the effects of database upgrade from 10.2 or higher releases on SQL Tuning Set performance. 
  Parameter Change Test and compare an initialization parameter change on SQL Tuning Set performance. 
  Optimizer Statistics Test and analyze the effects of optimizer statistics changes on SQL Tuning Set performance. 
  Exadata Simulation Simulate the effects of a Exadata Storage Server installation on SQL Tuning Set performance. 
  Guided Workflow Create a SQL Performance Analyzer Task and execute custom experiments using manually created SQL trials. 

Choose 'Guided Workflow'
Run the first step to create a SPA task - for a specific tuning set
Run the second step to run the trial on the initial/current environment
--> give option whether the task should run the sqls to get plan/stats or just take them from the tuning set itself
Run the third step (TBD)
Compare (TBD)
