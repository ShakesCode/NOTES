Good - 12c services, tnsnames: http://www.zhongweicheng.com/?p=1135

==================
CREATE NEW SERVICE
==================
NOTE: Upon 'add' service, it will not automatically start.  
      Do a 'start' service after that.
      Also, without 'start' it will not appear in v$parameter under service_names.
      
Syntax 11g:
srvctl add service -d db_unique_name -s service_name -r preferred_instanceName_list
[-a available_instanceName_list] [-P TAF_policy]

Syntax 12c:


Example:
srvctl add service -s gowrish1 -d DB1_UNIQUE_NAME -r DB11,DB12 -a DB13,DB14
srvctl start service -s gowrish1 -d DB1_UNIQUE_NAME -r DB11,DB12 -a DB13,DB14
srvctl status service -s gowrish1 -d DB1_UNIQUE_NAME

=============
LIST SERVICES
=============
LIST DEFAULT SERVICES FROM DATABASE
select name, value 
from gv$parameter
where name='service_names';

LIST ACTIVE SERVICES FROM DATABASE
select name, service_id, inst_id from gv$active_services

LIST SERVICES USING SRVCTL

srvctl config service -d DB_UNIQUE_NAME
srvctl status service -d DB_UNIQUE_NAME

# For additional DB info
srvctl config database -d DB_UNIQUE_NAME

LIST SERVICES USING CRSCTL
<< >>

LIST SERVICES USING CRS_STAT
<< >>

LIST SERVICES USING LSRCTL STATUS
lsnrctl status listener
lsnrctl services listener

SERVICE STATUS
srvctl status service -d db_unique_name

=================================================
RELOCATE SERVICE
=================================================
srvctl relocate service -db DB_UNIQUE_NAME  -service SERVICE_NAME -oldinst OLD_OR_CURR_INSTANCE -newinst NEW_INSTANCE
srvctl relocate service -db DB1_SITE1  -service SERVICE1 -oldinst DB11 -newinst DB12

=================================================
TNS ENTRY USING SERVICE AND CONNECT TIME FAILOVER
=================================================
NOTE: See separate tnsnames.ora related notes document for more details/examples

NOTE: In 11g and 12c
      A default service gets created with DB_UNIQUE_NAME when a DB is created.  
      It is also automatically registered with Listener.
      We can use it for connect-time failover between primary and standby DB's or between two disparate DBs.
      That can be done using DESCRIPTION_LIST.
      HOWEVER, if the same default service is used for standby DB creation 
      (by making static entries in listener.ora with the same name as that service name)
      then the same service cannot be used for connect time failover, TAF etc.
      
      In 12c a default service name by name of the PDB is created.
      Connect time failover works for that service unlike the service for db_unique_name
      
MYDB =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = prim-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = stby-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = MY_SERVICE_NAME)
    )
)

TNS ENTRY WITH DESCRIPTION LIST AND CONNECT TIME FAILOVER
NOTE: Here, the cluster1 and cluster2 are NOT primary-standby pair.
      This example shows two databases or two services on same or different clusters and connect to whichever is up.
MYDB =
(DESCRIPTION_LIST=
  (FAILOVER=true)
  (LOAD_BALANCE=false)
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = cluster1-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = SERVICE1)
    )
  )
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = cluster2-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = SERVICE2)
    )
  )
)
