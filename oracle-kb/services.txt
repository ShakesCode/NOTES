==================
CREATE NEW SERVICE
==================
Syntax 11g:
srvctl add service -d db_unique_name -s service_name -r preferred_instanceName_list
[-a available_instanceName_list] [-P TAF_policy]

Syntax 12c:


Example:
srvctl add service -s gowrish1 -d DB1_UNIQUE_NAME -r DB11,DB12 -a DB13,DB14
srvctl start service -s gowrish1 -d DB1_UNIQUE_NAME -r DB11,DB12 -a DB13,DB14
srvctl status service -s gowrish1 -d DB1_UNIQUE_NAME

=============
LIST SERVICES
=============
LIST DEFAULT SERVICES FROM DATABASE
select name, value 
from gv$parameter
where name='service_names';

LIST ACTIVE SERVICES FROM DATABASE
select name, service_id, inst_id from gv$active_services

LIST SERVICES USING SRVCTL

LIST SERVICES USING CRSCTL

LIST SERVICES USING CRS_STAT

LIST SERVICES USING LSRCTL STATUS
lsnrctl status listener
lsnrctl services listener

SERVICE STATUS
srvctl status service -d db_unique_name

TNS ENTRY USING SERVICE AND CONNECT TIME FAILOVER
NOTE: A default service gets created with DB_UNIQUE_NAME when a DB is created.  
      It is also automatically registered with Listener.
      We can use it for connect-time failover between primary and standby DB's or between two disparate DBs.
      That can be done using DESCRIPTION_LIST.
      HOWEVER, if the same default service is used for standby DB creation 
      (by making static entries in listener.ora with the same name as that service name)
      then the same service cannot be used for connect time failover, TAF etc.
      
MYDB =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = prim-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = stby-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = MY_SERVICE_NAME)
    )
)

TNS ENTRY WITH DESCRIPTION LIST AND CONNECT TIME FAILOVER
NOTE: Here, the cluster1 and cluster2 are NOT primary-standby pair.
      This example shows two databases or two services on same or different clusters and connect to whichever is up.
MYDB =
(DESCRIPTION_LIST=
  (FAILOVER=true)
  (LOAD_BALANCE=false)
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = cluster1-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = SERVICE1)
    )
  )
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = cluster2-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = SERVICE2)
    )
  )
)
