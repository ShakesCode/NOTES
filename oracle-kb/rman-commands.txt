RMAN Delete Command

The RMAN DELETE command deletes backups from disk and/or from the catalog

To delete all backups for the target database use:

RMAN> DELETE BACKUP;
Delete Backupset

To delete a backup set specify the set number e.g. 23:

RMAN> DELETE BACKUPSET 23;
NOPROMPT keyword

By default the DELETE command will prompt for confirmation before deleting any backup files

Do you really want to delete the above objects (enter YES or NO)?
To suppress the prompt specify the NOPROMPT keyword. For example:

RMAN> DELETE NOPROMPT BACKUP;

RMAN> DELETE DATAFILECOPY '/u01/app/oracle/copy/users01.dbf';
To delete a specific controlfile copy use:

RMAN> DELETE CONTROLFILECOPY <key>;
For example:

RMAN> DELETE CONTROLFILECOPY 20;
