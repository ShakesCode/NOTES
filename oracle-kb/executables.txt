Oracle Executables

This table lists executable programs in $ORACLE_HOME/bin (or %ORACLE_HOME%\bin on Windows) for Oracle Enterprise Edition, including shell scripts, Windows .bat files but excluding Windows DLLs or any that can't execute directly. It's not a complete list since what programs are in that directory depends on what options I chose at the time of software installation. I'm doing my best to give descriptions about each program and add some comments I consider useful or merely interesting. Many of them show Usage by typing the program name, or the name followed by some garbage argument, or -h, or sometimes help=y. "Not in 9i" means not in 9i and up (i.e. only in 8i). Files of 0 in size are ignored, such as tnnfg, trcldr (not any more in 12.1.0.2), plus those whose names end with 0 or O.

[2014-09 Update] Added 12.1.0.2 new binaries
[2013-09 Update] Added 12.1.0.1 new binaries
[2011-11 Update] Added 11.2.0.3 new binaries

kgmgr`		Forum:486682.995: "a proprietary utility used by several of our client products"
kgpmon`		
launch*	Program Launcher	E.g., on Windows, Oracle Net Assistant is not started by netasst program, which doesn't exist; instead it's launched by: %ORACLE_HOME%\bin\launch.exe "%ORACLE_HOME%\network\tools" netasst.cl. There're many other .cl files scattered around which basically call jrew somejarfile.

lxchknlb`		
lxegen	NLS Calendar	
lxinst	NLS Data Installation	
mapsga`		
maxmem`	Maximum Memory for a process	Oracle process virtual memory size is limited by the smaller of maxmem and ulimit -m. Windows doesn't have this utility simply because a process on Windows can potentially use all memory minus kernel non-paged pool.
mergelib`		Not in 9i
mig	Oracle Migration/Upgrading	Not in 10g. 9i documentation says mig "converts the data dictionary and structures of an Oracle7 database into Oracle9i format". 10g doesn't support direct upgrade from Oracle7 so it stops shipping this tool.

netmgr`		
nid	DB New ID	Change DBID so a database cloned using the traditional method (instead of DUPLICATEd by RMAN) can register with the same RMAN catalog as the source DB. The syntax is nid target=sys/syspassword. (It's not nid target="sys/syspassword as sysdba" even if you need as sysdba for sqlplus). After running nid, you have to open resetlogs, and database resetlogs time and v$thread.enable_time will both be updated.
nmb, nmcbufp, nmei, nmelproc, nmeo, nmesrvc, nmesrvcops, nmetm, nmo, nmocat, nmuct, nmupm		10g. "The nmo executable is responsible for authentication for the Agent installed with DB Control."

ocopy*	Oracle file copy program	Allegedly the only tool you should use to copy open datafiles. There's no difference between filesystem files copied by this and by DOS copy command. But if you use raw "files" (raw partitions used as Oracle datafiles), ocopy (or RMAN) has to be used.
ocrcheck, ocrconfig, ocrdump	Oracle Cluster Registry Check, Config and Dump utilities	10g. Run ocrcheck as root to do logical corruption check. Run ocrdump as root to get much more (perhaps all) info from OCR. Ocrconfig can only be run as root.

olsoidsync		10g
onrsd	Oracle Names client cache	Not in 10g
onsctl		10g
oo4ocodewiz*	Oracle Objects for OLE Code Wizard for stored procedures	
operfcfg*	Oracle Perfmon Config	
oracg	Oracle Class Generator	XML related. Deprecated in 10g and replaced by orajaxb in 11.2.0.3
oracle	Oracle RDBMS Kernel Executable	On UNIX, if dedicated configuration, every client process such as sqlplus or Toad, connects to tnslsnr, which fork()'s and then exec()'s oracle kernel program, $ORACLE_HOME/bin/oracle. The oracle process thus created is called a server process, or a shadow process to emphasize the client-server two-task nature. This server process is renamed to oracleSID (DESCRIPTION=(LOCAL=... for easy identification and troubleshooting. But its program (process text) is still this oracle binary. You should never directly run this binary; or you may get ORA-600 [12235] (see Note:33174.1; true for pre-11g). Oracle does not recommend changing the process priority. But some tests conclude it may improve DBWn performance if its priority is increased. You should also avoid stripping the oracle binary or you'll lose symbol information in trace files. But you can certainly run nm on it to get symbols such as sgabeg in this file. You can find all undocumented SQL hints by running strings on it, but 11g provides v$sql_hint view.
On Windows, there's always only one oracle.exe process for one instance. Each server "process" is just a Windows thread inside this process. If you have multiple Oracle instances running in Windows, you can identify the process for a specific instance with tools such as tlist. Oracle supports changing process priority on Windows.

OracleAdNetConnect*	OracleAdNetConnect MFC Application	
OracleAdNetTest*		
oradim*		Used to create a Windows service named OracleServiceSID
oradism`	Oracle Dynamic Intimate Shared Memory	Used on Solaris to configure Dynamic ISM, so as to get the benefit of shared page table between processes while allowing for SGA to be not completely locked in physical memory
oraenv`		Setup Oracle Environment; run as . oraenv and pass SID to it
orajaxb	Oracle Java Architecture for XML Binding	10g. XML JAXB Class Generator. Replacing oracg in 9i. Ref
orakill*		Usage: orakill instance_name v$process.spid. Used to kill a specific thread inside oracle.exe process. Apparently orakill does a little more than just killing the thread because using a non-Oracle tool such as Sysinternals's Process Explorer to kill a thread in oracle.exe doesn't always make a hanging session and its lock go away; you may have to manually run oradebug wakeup 1 to wake up pmon (which should clear the lock and v$session / v$process, but the client app may still hang). If you can't run orakill for any reason, use a tool like Process Explorer, followed by manual pmon wakeup.
orapipe		In 10g. Read Oracle XML Developer's Kit Programmer's Guide, Chapter "Pipeline Definition Language for Java"
orapki`, orapki.bat*	Oracle Public Key Infrastructure utility	In 10g. Read Oracle Database Advanced Security Administrator's Guide, Chapter "Configuring Secure Sockets Layer Authentication"
orapwd	Oracle Password utility	Used to create a password file for SYSDBA and SYSOPER connection. On Windows, you can also use oradim as a second choice (you have to delete and recreate if the password already exists).
orastack*	Oracle Stack modification	Used to resize the stack of an Oracle executable file such as oracle.exe, tnslsnr.exe (one way of preventing ORA-12500). Type the command at DOS to see an excellent description. (Not equivalent to pstack available on some UNIXes used to dump stack trace of a running process, but more like Solaris command ppgsz -o stack=... except it works on file not process)
oratclsh	Oracle TCL Shell	TCL programming language shell for Oracle. In spite of Oracle's advocacy, few people actually used it and now it's silently deprecated by Oracle, probably in favor of Perl. One trivial usage is to retrieve error messages on any OS (see examples here). Extensive use can be found in J. Morle's Scaling Oracle8i. Not in 10g Windows and not working in 10g Linux/UNIX.
oraxml		
oraxsl

sqlj	SQLJ engine	Not in 10g (SqlJ is deprecated)
sqlldr	SQL*Loader	See Oracle Utilities

statusnc	Status of Native Compiler	Probably checks sys.jaccelerator$status. Ref: Note:4889370
svrmgrl	Server Manager	Not in 9i. Use sqlplus '/ as sysdba' instead (substitute " for ' in Windows)
symfind`	Symbol Finder.	Documented in 10g Admin's Reference for UNIX.
sysresv`	System Resources Verifier	Shows (or removes) IPC resources: shared memory segments and semaphores. Safer than ipcrm in removing the resources. By default, it shows the resources for the instance identified by environment variable $ORACLE_SID. You can pass -l SID to override it.
tdvapp*		Not in 10g
tkprof		Used to get more meaningful output from a session trace file
tnslsnr	TNS listener	You run this program from lsnrctl. Only run this program directly, as root, if you start listener on a port below 1024 on UNIX; even in this case, stopping the listener can be done with lsnrctl.
tnsping	TNS Ping	Note you can have two arguments, the second being the number of times the listener is pinged.
transx	XML Translator	See XML Developer's Kit Programmer's Guide, Chapter "TransX Utility". Ref: Note:394803.1.
trcasst	SQL*Net Trace Assistant	Used to analyze SQL*Net trace file
trcsess	Session Trace	In 10g. See Database Performance Tuning Guide, Chapter "Using Application Tracing Tools". It merges multiple SQL trace files for a session to be used by tkprof. Useful in Shared Server session trace. Before 10g, try OraSRP.

zip	Zip	Compression tool, the same as under /usr/bin (if on *NIX)

From 11g on, I no longer add new entries to the above table. Instead, a separate table is created for each version. Again, only interesting comments are made.

Mostly based on binaries in $ORACLE_HOME/bin on x86_64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 running Oracle 11.2.0.1.0 RAC, supplemented with 11.2.0.2.0.
adrci	Automatic Diagnostic Repository Command Interpreter	See numerous articles in documentation, and its Incident Packaging Service (IPS) in Note:738732.1
amdu	ASM Metadata Dump Utility	Creates amdu_time/report.txt for ASM disk usage. Get help by amdu help=y. Ref: 1485597.1.
aqxmlctl	AQ XML Control	See Deploying the Oracle Database XML Servlet
bndlchk	Bundle Check	Shell script to check what libvns contains to determine if you have Enterprise Edition or Standard Edition installed. Run ls -l $ORACLE_HOME/install/.ee $ORACLE_HOME/install/.std after you run this script to see which file was created.
chopt	Change Option	Shell script to call chopt.pl to enable or disable optional components (as seen in v$option). See chopt.ini for detailed make commands to change these options
cluvfy	Cluster Verification
commonenv	Common Environment	Seems for EM only
crsdiag.pl	CRS Diagnostics	Creates gzipped tar files for OCR, OS and CRS data to send to Oracle support. Run as root
db2gc		Script to configure Oracle EM dbconsole mode for a software only install
dbfs_client	DBFS Client	Using the DBFS Command Interface
dg4odbc	Database Gateway for ODBC	Configure Oracle Net Listener for the Gateway
diagsetup	11g installation Diag Setup	See Note:818727.1 for usage
diskmon.bin	I/O Fencing and SKGXP HA monitoring daemon	Logs are at $CRS_HOME/log/`hostname -s`/diskmon
dsml2ldif	Directory Services Mark-up Language to LDIF conversion

gnsd	Grid Naming Service Daemon	No need to use it
jssu	Job Scheduler su	Note:976049.1: "Jssu is called by the dbms_scheduler when credentials are used". User RnR in msg 11 of this thread shows one usage.
mkpatch	Make Patch	Creates a patch file
olsnodes	Oracle List Nodes	The new -t option shows whether you pinned the node with crsctl pin css -n (used when pre-10g database is installed with 11g clusterware), and -c shows the clustername.
orabase	Oracle Base	Returns ORACLE_BASE; first appears in 11gR1; checks ORACLE_BASE in $ORACLE_HOME/inventory/ContentsXML/oraclehomeproperties.xml on UNIX/Linux (Ref)
orion	Oracle IO Numbers	I/O benchmark tool. Type orion -help for help
pafctl	Provisioning Advisor Framework Control	Control the provisioning daemon (Ref)
platform_common`	Platform Common	"Script to export platform specific variables", called by dbca, dbua, netca, rconfig (RAC config tool).
plshprof	PL/SQL Hotspot Profiler	Note:763944.1 and Documentation
racgeut	?	Looks like a command execution wrapper. Usage: racgeut [-e environment_setting] timeout command. Try racgeut -e A=B 30 /bin/sleep 20 &, followed by ps eww $!. You'll see the added environment variable and assigned value A=B. You can add more environment variables with more "-e name=value" strings.
racgmain	RAC Global Main script	It's better to run it with racgwrap. You're supposed to be able to run it to check resource status (not recommended, documented way preferred, e.g. srvctl|crsctl status): racgmain resource_full_name check, followed by echo $?, and read $ORACLE_HOME/log/`hostname -s`/racg/resourcename.log. But 11gR2 seems to miss the required racgimon so it always throws error.
racgwrap	RAC Global Wrapper script	Wrapper for racgmain. Control tracing by passing _USR_ORA_DEBUG to racgmain (see above).
renamedg	Raname Disk Group	New in 11gR2. See Note:948040.1 for usage.
setasmgid	Set ASM Group ID	Ref
skgxpinfo	OS Kernel Generic Inter-Process-communication Info	New in 11.2.0.2. Returns IPC protocol, udp by default

srvctl	Server Control	Generally, only used if RAC CRS is running, not used even if ASM is running. Ref
trcsess	Trace Sessions	Enable SQL trace from command line
uidrvci	?	ADR related. E.g., uidrvci /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/db_name/instance_name/trace getSchema INC_METER_SUMMARY, where INC_METER_SUMMARY is an .ams file under the trace/metadata subdir of the directory in the second arg. This getSchema command shows the table definition of v$incmeter_summary (summary of incident meters). Not sure what use this command really has.
wrc	Workload Replay Client	Documentation, Note:445116.1, Note:748895.1.
xmlwf	XML Well-Formedness check	An extra copy of standard UNIX/Linux command (just like unzip)
