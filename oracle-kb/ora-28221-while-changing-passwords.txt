When trying to change one's own password using alter user - AND - if a password verify function is involved, 
then, the 'previous password' needs to be provided in alter user statement - as it is not using the 'password' command of sqlplus.
ALTER USER MYSELF IDENTIFIED BY MY_NEW_PASSWORD REPLACE MY_OLD_PASSWORD;

Otherwise, this error will come by - ORA-28221: REPLACE not specified

Alternatively, use a different user that has alter user privilege to change password of a user.

** This could be common in case of password-vault where a checkout ID rotates its own password upon checkout.
