How to Stop/Start RAC components
January 3, 2013 in Oracle Database&EBS General | Tags: CRS command, rac command, START RAC db, Stop rac, stop rac db
In this article, I am going to explain how to stop/start rac components. Here is the my system:

My db version : 11.2.0.3
My Operating System : AIX 7.1
My servers hostname : node1-node2
My database name : TEST01
My instance name : TEST011-TEST012

Here is the some basic  commands, for commands details&options  please review Reference docs:


Checking CRS Status
[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> crsctl check crs

CRS-4638: Oracle High Availability Services is online
CRS-4537: Cluster Ready Services is online
CRS-4529: Cluster Synchronization Services is online
CRS-4533: Event Manager is online

[oracle@node2]</home/oracle> crsctl check crs

CRS-4638: Oracle High Availability Services is online
CRS-4537: Cluster Ready Services is online
CRS-4529: Cluster Synchronization Services is online
CRS-4533: Event Manager is online

Checking Node Status

[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> srvctl status nodeapps

VIP node1-vip is enabled
VIP node1-vip is running on node: node1
VIP 192.168.100.101 is enabled
VIP 192.168.100.101 is running on node: node2
Network is enabled
Network is running on node: node1
Network is running on node: node2
GSD is disabled
GSD is not running on node: node1
GSD is not running on node: node2
ONS is enabled
ONS daemon is running on node: node1
ONS daemon is running on node: node2

[oracle@node2]</home/oracle> srvctl status nodeapps

VIP node1-vip is enabled
VIP node1-vip is running on node: node1
VIP 192.168.100.101 is enabled
VIP 192.168.100.101 is running on node: node2
Network is enabled

GSD is disabled
GSD is not running on node: node1
GSD is not running on node: node2
ONS is enabled
ONS daemon is running on node: node1
ONS daemon is running on node: node2

Checking Clusterware Resource Status
[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> crsctl status resource -t

I will not paste result because output is not clear in that page

You can use below command which is not recommended for 11g and which is depreciated

[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> crs_stat -t

Oracle High Availability Services

— disable/enable Oracle HAS.
Use the “crsctl enable/disable has” command to disable automatic startup of the Oracle High Availability Services stack when the server boots up.

To can see current settings for Oracle High Availability Services stack when the server boots up, follow:

[root@node1]crsctl config has
CRS-4622: Oracle High Availability Services autostart is enabled.

or

[root@node1]cat /etc/oracle/scls_scr/node1/root/ohasdstr
enable

So as you can see my current setting is enable.If your system shown disable than :

For Disable:
[root@node1]crsctl disable has
CRS-4621: Oracle High Availability Services autostart is disabled.

[root@node1] crsctl config has
CRS-4621: Oracle High Availability Services autostart is disabled.

# cat /etc/oracle/scls_scr/node1/root/ohasdstr
disable

For Enable:
[root@node1]crsctl enable has
CRS-4621: Oracle High Availability Services autostart is enabled.

Check new setting:

[root@node1] crsctl config has
CRS-4621: Oracle High Availability Services autostart is enabled.

[root@node1] cat /etc/oracle/scls_scr/node1/root/ohasdstr
enable

Stop the Oracle clusterware stack

You can use below commands:

With root user:

crsctl stop crs or crsctl stop has

Start the Oracle clusterware stack

You can use below commands:

With root user:
crsctl start crs or crsctl start has

[root@node1] crsctl start crs
CRS-4123: Oracle High Availability Services has been started.

Start the Oracle Database
To start all Oracle RAC instances for a database:
[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> $ORACLE_HOME/bin/srvctl start database -d db_name

PS: db_name is the name of the databasethis command is starting all the instances

Stop the Oracle Database
To shut down all Oracle RAC instances for a database:
[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> $ORACLE_HOME/bin/srvctl stop database -d db_name

PS: db_name is the name of the databasethis command is starting all the instances

Start the Oracle Instance:

[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> $ORACLE_HOME/bin/srvctl start instance –d db_name –i instance_name

Stop the Oracle Instance:

[oracle@node1]</home/oracle> $ORACLE_HOME/bin/srvctl stop instance –d db_name –i instance_name
Stop/Start Listener-SCAN_LISTENER
–
srvctl stop/start listener -n node1
srvctl stop/start listener -n node2
srvctl stop scan_listener

Stop ASM

srvctl stop asm [-o stop_options] [-f]
