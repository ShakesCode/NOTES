Installation


For general Instant Client information, see the Home Page.

ODBC users should follow the ODBC Installation Instructions.

Oracle Linux users with a ULN Subscription may prefer to install Oracle Instant Client from the ol7_x86_64_instantclient or ol6_x86_64_instantclient channels.


Installation of ZIP files: 

1. Download the desired Instant Client ZIP files. All installations require the Basic or Basic Light package.

2. Unzip the packages into a single directory such as /opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2 that is accessible to your application. For example:

  cd /opt/oracle			
  unzip instantclient-basic-linux.x64-12.2.0.1.0.zip

3. Create the appropriate links for the version of Instant Client, if the links do not exist. For example:

  cd /opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2
  ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so
  ln -s libocci.so.12.1 libocci.so

4. Install the libaio package. This is called libaio1 on some Linux distributions.

For example, on Oracle Linux, run:

  sudo yum install libaio

5. If Instant Client is the only Oracle Software installed on this system then update the runtime link path, for example:

  sudo sh -c "echo /opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2 > \
      /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf"
  sudo ldconfig

Alternatively, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable prior to running applications. For example:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The variable can optionally be added to configuration files such as ~/.bash_profile and to application configuration files such as /etc/sysconfig/httpd.

6. If you intend to co-locate optional Oracle configuration files such as tnsnames.ora, sqlnet.ora, ldap.ora, or oraaccess.xml with Instant Client, then create a network/admin subdirectory. For example:

  mkdir -p /opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2/network/admin

This is the default Oracle configuration directory for applications linked with this Instant Client.

Alternatively, Oracle configuration files can be put in another, accessible directory. Then set the environment variable TNS_ADMIN to that directory name.

7. To use binaries such as sqlplus from the SQL*Plus package, unzip the package to the same directory as the Basic package and then update your PATH environment variable, for example:

  export PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2:$PATH

8. Start your application.



Installation of RPM files: 

1. Download the desired Instant Client RPM packages. All installations require the Basic or Basic Light RPM.

2. Install the packages with yum. For example:

  sudo yum install oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
  
  --> My comments: This creates /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64 and its contents

3. If Instant Client is the only Oracle Software installed on this system then update the runtime link path, for example:

  sudo sh -c "echo /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib > \
      /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf"
  sudo ldconfig

Alternatively, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable prior to running applications. For example:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  --> My comments - probably this should be /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib or /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64

The variable can optionally be added to configuration files such as ~/.bash_profile and to application configuration files such as /etc/sysconfig/httpd.

4. If you intend to co-locate optional Oracle configuration files such as tnsnames.ora, sqlnet.ora ldap.ora, or oraaccess.xml with Instant Client, then create a network/admin subdirectory under lib/. For example:

  sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/network/admin

This is the default Oracle configuration directory for applications linked with this Instant Client.

Alternatively, Oracle configuration files can be put in another, accessible directory. Then set the environment variable TNS_ADMIN to that directory name.

5. To use binaries such as sqlplus from the SQL*Plus package, use yum to install the package and then update your PATH environment variable, for example:

  export PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/bin:$PATH

6. Start your application.
