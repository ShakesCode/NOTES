PROBLEM WITH DB_UNIQUE_NAME SERVICE - it does not provide connect time failover when configured in tnsnames.or or jdbc
--> That service is good only for single-site (in DR config) connection
--> and it is used primarily by standy setup - and not intended for app use with connect time failover
--> MUST USE a separate service for apps

QUESTION --> how does that work for 12c PDBs?  
--> Should we have a separate service always or the default PDB service with listener provide that capability?
