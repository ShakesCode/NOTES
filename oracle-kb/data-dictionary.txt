=================================
    ORACLE DATA DICTIONARY
=================================

DBCA command/UI creates data dictionary by itself.
If using CREATE DATABASE command instead (or if dbca somehow fails to create everything or compiles some of them invalid):
  In SQL*Plus run as sysdba user (like sys)
  @?/rdbms/admin/catalog.sql
  @?/rdbms/admin/catproc.sql
  
  In SQL*Plus, connect to your Oracle Database instance as SYSTEM user:
  @?/sqlplus/admin/pupbld.sql
