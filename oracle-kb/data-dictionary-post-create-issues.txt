    ORACLE DATA DICTIONARY POST-CREATE ISSUES
===============================================

DBCA command/UI creates data dictionary by itself.
If using CREATE DATABASE command instead (or if dbca somehow fails to create everything or compiles some of them invalid):
  In SQL*Plus run as sysdba user (like sys)
  @?/rdbms/admin/catalog.sql
  @?/rdbms/admin/catproc.sql
  
  In SQL*Plus, connect to your Oracle Database instance as SYSTEM user:
  @?/sqlplus/admin/pupbld.sql

SYMPTOMS

The following errors are reported running a Datapump full export.

CAUSE

In this case the issue was raised because there are some Logminer dictionary objects invalid, which was confirmed by the output of the following query:

select owner,object_name,object_type,status
from dba_objects
where status = 'INVALID';
OWNER  OBJECT_NAME              OBJECT_TYPE   STATUS
------ ------------------------ ------------- --------
SYS    DBMS_LOGMNR_LOGREP_DICT  PACKAGE BODY  INVALID
SYS    DBMS_LOGMNR_SESSION      PACKAGE BODY  INVALID
SYS    DBMS_SQLTCB_INTERNAL     PACKAGE BODY  INVALID
 
The reason for those objects to be invalid is because there are some missing sequences:

LOGMNR_UIDS$  (Associated with DBMS_LOGMNR_LOGREP_DICT)
LOGMNR_SEQ$  (Associated with DBMS_LOGMNR_SESSION)
The missing sequence issue was confirmed executing the following commands:

SQL> alter package sys.DBMS_LOGMNR_LOGREP_DICT compile body;
Warning: Package Body altered with compilation errors.
SQL> show errors
Errors for PACKAGE BODY SYS.DBMS_LOGMNR_LOGREP_DICT:
LINE/COL ERROR
-------- ---------------------------------------------------------
83/11    PL/SQL: SQL Statement ignored
83/25    PL/SQL: ORA-02289: sequence does not exist

Those sequence are created by file dlmnr.bsq but for some reason those are missing at database level.


SOLUTION

To solve the issue, execute next steps:

Move to the directory where the script dlmnr.bsq is located:
cd $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
  

Execute the script connected as sysdba:
SQL> connect /as sysdba
SQL> @dlmnr.bsq;
  

Check if the sequences are created:
SQL> select object_name,object_type,status
     from dba_objects
     where object_name in ('LOGMNR_UIDS$','LOGMNR_SEQ$');
  

Run ultrp.sql connected as sysdba to recompile the invalid objects:
SQL> connect /as sysdba
SQL> @ultrp;
  

Execute the export process again.
