This may not be a problem:
CLOSED - Disk is present in the storage system but is not being accessed by Oracle ASM

http://itwithcoffee.blogspot.in/2014/04/asm-disk-mount-status-closed-and-header.html

ASM Disk mount status closed and header status member / v$asm_disk name value empty
Environment
RAC two nodes with five ASM Disks on Virtual Box


Problem
Four of the disks have a mount status of CACHED and mode status of ONLINE.
This means that the disk is currently part of ASM disk group.
But, one disk has a  mount status of CLOSED.


Header_status=MEMBER
Disk is a member of an existing disk group.
Mount_status=CACHED
Disk is present in the storage system, and is part of a disk group being accessed by ASM
Mount_status=CLOSED
Disk is present in the storage system but is not being accessed by ASM

Solution
SQL> select name, path, mount_status, mode_status, header_status from v$asm_disk;

NAME       PATH                   MOUNT_ST  MODE_ST     HEADER_ST
-----------  -----------------   --------------  --------------  --------------
                ORCL:DISK01    CLOSED        ONLINE        MEMBER
DISK02      ORCL:DISK02    CACHED       ONLINE        MEMBER
DISK03      ORCL:DISK03    CACHED       ONLINE        MEMBER
DISK04      ORCL:DISK04    CACHED       ONLINE        MEMBER
DISK05      ORCL:DISK05    CACHED       ONLINE        MEMBER


[oracle@rac1 ~]$ oracleasm listdisks
DISK01 (sdb1)
DISK02  (sdc1)
DISK03 (sdd1)
DISK04 (sde1)
DISK05 (sdf1)

In Oracle docs says,
If ASM recognizes a disk header as that of an Oracle object, such as the header of an Oracle datafile, 
the disk is discovered, but can only be added to a disk group with the FORCE keyword. 
Such a disk appears in V$ASM_DISK with a header status of FOREIGN.

SQL> alter diskgroup DATA add disk 'ORCL:DISK01' force;

Diskgroup altered.

SQL> select path, mount_status, header_status, mode_status from v$asm_disk;

PATH                    MOUNT_S HEADER_ST  MODE_ST
------------------- ------------- ---------------  ------------
ORCL:DISK01     CACHED     MEMBER        ONLINE
ORCL:DISK02     CACHED     MEMBER        ONLINE
ORCL:DISK03     CACHED     MEMBER        ONLINE
ORCL:DISK04     CACHED     MEMBER        ONLINE
ORCL:DISK05     CACHED     MEMBER        ONLINE

Or you can use dd statement.

To correct this you will have to clear the disk header to add it again:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb1(your device path) bs=4096 count=5000

This command will clear the disk header and after that disk will be added successfully.
