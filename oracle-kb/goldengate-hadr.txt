BOUNDED RECOVERY

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/availability/maa-goldengate-rac-2007111.pdf
The Bounded Recovery (BR) feature was added to Extract in Oracle GoldenGate version 11.1.1. This
feature guarantees an efficient recovery after Extract stops for any reason, planned or unplanned, no
matter how many open (uncommitted) transactions there were at the time that Extract stopped and no
matter how old they were. Bounded Recovery sets an upper boundary for the maximum amount of
time that it would take for Extract to recover to the point where it stopped and then resume normal
processing. The Bounded Recovery checkpoint files should be placed on a shared file system such that
in an event of a failover when there are open long running transactions, Extract can use Bounded
Recovery to reduce the time to taken to perform recovery. Starting in Oracle GoldenGate version
11.2.1 the Bounded Recovery files are supported and it is recommended that you place them on DBFS.
With earlier releases the Bounded Recovery files need to be stored on NFS storage such as Oracle ZFS
Storage Appliance. It is possible to store the checkpoint files on the local file system, but when Extract
performs recovery after a node failure, the standard checkpoint mechanism will be used until new local
Bounded Recovery checkpoint files are subsequently created. This will only be noticeable if there are
long running transactions at the time of the failure.
To set the Bounded Recovery file directory use the following Extract parameter:
BR BRDIR /mnt/gg_source/goldengate/BR
