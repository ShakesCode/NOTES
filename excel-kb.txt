Example:
This formula looks up the sheet CLUSTER-SERVER-SHEET for a range of rows from A2 to B75,
matches ColB of current sheet in the table and returns 2nd column of the table

=(VLOOKUP(B36,'CLUSTER-SERVER-SHEET'!$A$2:$B$75,2,0))

Current sheet contains:
ColA = use the above formula to find cluster name from CLUSTER-SERVER-SHEET for the key in ColB of this sheet
ColB = server name

Sheet CLUSTER-SERVER-SHEET contains
ColA = server name (to match the ColB of current sheet)
ColB = cluster name
