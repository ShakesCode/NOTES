AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS enables or disables the auditing of top-level operations, which are SQL statements directly issued by users when connecting with the SYSASM, SYSBACKUP, SYSDBA, SYSDG, SYSKM, or SYSOPER privileges. (SQL statements run from within PL/SQL procedures or functions are not considered top-level.) The audit records are written to the operating system's audit trail. The audit records will be written in XML format if the AUDIT_TRAIL initialization parameter is set to xml or xml, extended.
