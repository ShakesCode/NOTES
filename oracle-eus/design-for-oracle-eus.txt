===============================================================
EUS DESIGN FOR ORACLE WITH LDAP AUTHENTICTION AND AUTHORIZATION
===============================================================
HOW TO  - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52734_01/oud/OUDAG/eus.htm#OUDAG11381

=====================
VARIOUS THINGS
=====================
Revoke 'dba' group from all unix users that are DBAs now
Revoke sudo to oracle
SYSDBA cannot be granted to a 'global role' in the database - so can we give it to the enterprise role directly?
--> and give that enterprise role to users in LDAP?

=====================
IDEA/GOAL/POSSIBILITY
=====================
One user can access multiple databases
In each DB the user may have different privileges - system or objects
Those privileges are given via global roles

???Global roles are mapped to groups in LDAP???

A 'global user' is created in the DB to act as a channel into the DB to all 'enterprise users' that are in LDAP.

The DB is registered in the LDAP server.
Enterprise roles are defined in LDAP server

==========================
ARTIFACTS
==========================
Enterprise Roles - in LDAP
Enterprise Users - in LDAP
Global Ident User - in DB --> this is the channel for Enterprise Users to logon to DB
Global Roles - in DB --> associate them with Enterprise Roles
Local Roles - in DB --> create if necessary to give grants to them and give local roles to global roles
--> note that SYSDBA cannot be given to a global role --> explore if it can be given direcly to Enterprise Role


=================
USERS
=================
- Users common heirarchy
Bind DN for a user with username userid1 - cn=userid1,ou=people,cn=corp,cn=company,cn=com

=================
DB ROLES
=================
SYS will not have any role as its role cannot be given to others apart from o/s or password authentication directly.

DBA     - Full infra DBA - will do all DBA activity
PDB_DBA - Full infra DBA at PDB level - will do all DBA activity for PDBs

APP_DBA_L1 - Limited application DBA - who can do SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE etc
APP_DBA_L2 - Limited application DBA - who can do SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE, ALTER TABLESPACE etc

BI_QUERY_1 - Users that can query certain tables in certain BI databases.  Will be created in those DB's only (one or more DB)
BI_QUERY_2 - Users that can query certain tables in certain other BI databases.  Will be created in those DB's only (one or more DB)
NOTE: BI_QUERY_1 and BI_QUERY_2 could be roles in multiple DB's assigned to multiple users 
      - to reduce multiple different roles in each DB - to simplify enterprise-user management in LDAP

BI_APP1_USER - User that can update data in APP1 application's DB - probably that app may have just one DB
      - Here, LDAP will mostly act as a placeholder for architecture sake than simplify anything as only
