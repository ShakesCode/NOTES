First, we go to the Certification Matrix Home Page at:

     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/ias/downloads/fusion-certification-100350.htmlhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/ias/downloads/fusion-certification-100350.html

Then we look in System Requirements and Supported Platforms for Oracle Identity and Access Management 11g Release 2 (11.1.2.3.0) at:
    
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/id-mgmt/documentation/identity-access-111230certmatrix-2539086.xlsxhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/id-mgmt/documentation/identity-access-111230certmatrix-2539086.xlsx

If we look in Cell A,2 we see this Certification Matrix covers Oracle Unified Directory.

We then click on the link in K,8 and we find certifications for Systems.

In row 15 we find certification for RHEL 7 with OUD 11.1.2.3.

OUD 11.1.2.3 is certified with RHEL 7.

The plus(+) sign following a version number means that version and any subsequent minor version is supported.
