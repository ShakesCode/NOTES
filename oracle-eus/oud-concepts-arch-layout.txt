Centrify AD Query (adquery) can give a output like the following:
    $ adquery user -A user1
    unixname:dbgsm0
    uid:184592927
    gid:187248470
    gecos:Firstname.Lastname
    home://home/user1
    shell:/bin/bash
    auditLevel:AuditIfPossible
    isAlwaysPermitLogin:false
    dn:CN=user1,OU=Employees,OU=People,DC=corp,DC=company,DC=com
    samAccountName:user1
    displayName:Firstname.Lastname

    canonicalName:corp.company.com/People/Employees/user1

DN - Distinguished Name
------------
Note the 'DN' -  dn:CN=user1,OU=Employees,OU=People,DC=corp,DC=company,DC=com
It is a DN (Distinguished Name) 
- A series of comma-separated key/value pairs used to identify entries uniquely in the directory hierarchy). 
- The DN is actually the entry's fully qualified name.
- The above comma separated string must be read right to left:
    The string is a path from an hierarchical structure (DIT = Directory Information Tree) 
    and should be read from right (root) to left (leaf).
    
  DN = Distinguished Name
  RDN = Relative Distinguished Name
  CN = Common Name
  OU = Organizational Unit
  DC = Domain Component
  
Another example:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18756688/what-are-cn-ou-dc-in-an-ldap-search
("CN=Dev-India,OU=Distribution Groups,DC=gp,DC=gl,DC=google,DC=com");
In effect the query is:

From the com Domain Component, find the google Domain Component, and then inside it the gl Domain Component 
and then inside it the gp Domain Component.

In the gp Domain Component, find the Organizational Unit called Distribution Groups and then find the the object 
that has a common name of Dev-India.

DN, RDN, ATTRIBUTE
------------------------------
http://www.zytrax.com/books/ldap/apa/binddn.html

In the two DN's below:
DN1 is not used for logon purposes.  So, the last CN can be 'ram raj' or the UID 'ramr'. 
    And, DN1 is searchable.
    
DN2 is used for logon, with optional password. So, the UID is now a RDN (see tree below) and not just an attribute of a RDN.
    And, DN2 is not searchable (??)
    And, it has to be a 'bind DN'

Base DN: (see source 3 later below)
It could be at the level dc=example,dc=com
or ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

Uniqueness:
At the end, in an organization/company, the DN's must be unique across the organization/company

DN1 = cn=ram raj,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
DN2 = uid=ramr,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

DN1 Heirarchy:
RDN1 --> dc=example,dc=com
  RDN2 --> ou=people
    RDN3 --> cn=ram raj (also an attribute?)
        ATTRIBUTE --> uid=ramr
        
DN2 Heirarchy:
RDN1 --> dc=example,dc=com
  RDN2 --> ou=people
    ATTRIBUTE --> cn=ram raj
        RDN3 --> uid=ramr

- Base DN
For a single domain Active Directory Domain Service, this is the text box for the Distinguished Name (DN) of the starting point 
for directory server searches. For example: DC=mycompany,DC=com. The Connector starts from this DN to create master lists from which 
you can later filter out individual users and groups.

For a multidomain Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) forest, the appropriate action is to leave this text box blank.

- Bind DN
The text box for the full distinguished name (DN), including common name (CN), of an Active Directory user account that has privileges to search for users.
For example: CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=mycompany,DC=com. 
This user account must have at least domain user privileges.
Note
The Bind DN user, such as Administrator, is the username associated with the Bind DN user account. The Connector creates a 
corresponding user account as an administrative user in Application Manager. You use the username for this account to log in 
to Application Manager as an administrator.

For a single domain Active Directory Domain Service, the Bind DN entry must be located in the same branch and below the Base DN.
For a multidomain Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) forest, because you leave the Base DN text box empty, the restrictions that apply for a single domain do not apply for a multidomain forest.

- Bind Password
The text box for the Active Directory password for the account that can search for users.
Note
The Bind password is the same password used in association with the Bind DN user account.

Bind DN:
A bind DN is an object that you bind to inside LDAP to give you permissions to do whatever you're trying to do.

The bindDN DN is basically the credential you are using to authenticate against an LDAP. 
When using a bindDN it usually comes with a password associated with it.

Base DN:
The baseDN of a search is the starting point. Where it will start searching. Pretty self-explanatory.

https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000047740
Set the LDAP users, groups, and netgroups base Distinguished Name (DN). 
-->> This DN is used by PAM/NSS to search LDAP groups.

users-basedn value
  Specifies the value for the users-basedn.
  For example:
  ou=users,dc=yourorg,dc=example,dc=com (default)

groups-basedn value
  Specifies the value for the groups-basedn.
  For example:
  ou=groups,dc=yourorg,dc=example,dc=com (default)

netgroups-basedn value
  Specifies the value for the netgroups-basedn.
  For example:
  ou=netgroups,dc=yourorg,dc=example,dc=com (default)
