Centrify AD Query (adquery) can give a output like the following:
    $ adquery user -A user1
    unixname:dbgsm0
    uid:184592927
    gid:187248470
    gecos:Firstname.Lastname
    home://home/user1
    shell:/bin/bash
    auditLevel:AuditIfPossible
    isAlwaysPermitLogin:false
    dn:CN=user1,OU=Employees,OU=People,DC=corp,DC=company,DC=com
    samAccountName:user1
    displayName:Firstname.Lastname
    sid:S-1-5-21-45967694-2129082412-1561875151-43551
    userPrincipalName:user1@corp.company.com
    canonicalName:corp.company.com/People/Employees/user1
    passwordHash:x

DN - Distinguished Name
------------
Note the 'DN' -  dn:CN=user1,OU=Employees,OU=People,DC=corp,DC=company,DC=com
It is a DN (Distinguished Name) 
- A series of comma-separated key/value pairs used to identify entries uniquely in the directory hierarchy). 
- The DN is actually the entry's fully qualified name.
- The above comma separated string must be read right to left:
    The string is a path from an hierarchical structure (DIT = Directory Information Tree) 
    and should be read from right (root) to left (leaf).
    
  DN = Distinguished Name
  CN = Common Name
  OU = Organizational Unit
  DC = Domain Component
  
Another example:
("CN=Dev-India,OU=Distribution Groups,DC=gp,DC=gl,DC=google,DC=com");
In effect the query is:

From the com Domain Component, find the google Domain Component, and then inside it the gl Domain Component 
and then inside it the gp Domain Component.

In the gp Domain Component, find the Organizational Unit called Distribution Groups and then find the the object 
that has a common name of Dev-India.

DN's
=====================

Bind DN:
A bind DN is an object that you bind to inside LDAP to give you permissions to do whatever you're trying to do.

The bindDN DN is basically the credential you are using to authenticate against an LDAP. 
When using a bindDN it usually comes with a password associated with it.

Base DN:
The baseDN of a search is the starting point. Where it will start searching. Pretty self-explanatory.
