Yes, if you add "LDAP" to the path, OUD or any directory (OVD, OID) configured in ldap.ora is used to find the connect string 
for that particular "service name". 

That service name is the database name, which was registered in directory or a TNS alias for an existing database. 

As you may know the current version of OUD does not support Aliases and as a workaround one may use "smart referrals" 
instead of TNS Alias if you required to have multiple names for the same database .  

You can always test the TNS resolution using "tnsping" command. For example "tnsping DB_NAME|DB_UNIQUE_NAME".
Please verify the output of the command and see whether LDAP was used to resolve the TNS name .
