CAUTIONS and MUST-DOs WHILE CONFIGURING EUS WITH OUD
====================================================

1. DB server - Set environment in DB registry using srvctl setenv:

NOTE: This is to avoid ORA-28030
NOTE: After setting them, restart the DB and Listener

ORACLE_BASE
TNS_ADMIN
ORACLE_HOME - it is also suggested to set ORACLE_HOME

srvctl setenv database -d DB_UNIQUE_NAME -t ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle
srvctl setenv database -d DB_UNIQUE_NAME -t TNS_ADMIN=/usr/local/tns
srvctl setenv database -d DB_UNIQUE_NAME -t ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4

2. DB server & client machines - Add LDAP as a search path along with TNSNAMES and EZCONNECT
NOTE: JDBC client machines probably do not need sqlnet.ora as they dont use sqlplus and such

NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH= (LDAP, TNSNAMES, EZCONNECT)

3. DB server - Add the following in sqlnet.ora to avoid errors from clients like JDBC

The setting '8' will allow clients/jdbc-drivers from 10g (or 9i) onwards without issues 

SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION=8
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_CLIENT=8
SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER=8

4. DB server - For 12c DB's with PDBs, create a soft-link in $ORACLE_HOME to $ORACLE_BASE/admin

This is to avoid ORA-28030 when connecting to PDB using enterprise user
NOTE: However, the error seemed to vanish later though the link was removed - anyway, be safe, add link

5. OUD Server - Set password policy as 'AES' for LDAP admin user
NOTE: Otherwise 12c eusm does not work if LDAB admin user's password is non AES

6. OUD Server - For OUD, use JDK version less than Java7-75
It needs sslv3 protocol - either use less than Java 7u75 - OR - enable sslv3 in higher versions of Java
Starting with JDK 7u75 release, the SSLv3 protocol (Secure Socket Layer) has been deactivated and is not available by default.
