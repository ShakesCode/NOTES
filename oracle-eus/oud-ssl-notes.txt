CONNECTING TO A DIRECTORY - NOT SPECIFICALLY OUD
================================================
NOTE: Looks like we use SSL+User+Password method in OUD - when we set ldap_directory_access=PASSWORD in init.ora
      --> See the notes from the site below.

Security Level
Meaning
Go to step...
Anonymous
Connects to the directory anonymously.
10
User + Password
Connects to the directory using your username and password.
8
SSL + Anonymous
Connects to the directory anonymously, via an SSL link. The SSL connection uses either the trusted public certificate of the 
directory server, or the public certificate of the directory server's certificate authority.
10
SSL + User + Password
Connects to the directory using your username and password, via an SSL link. The SSL connection 
uses either the trusted public certificate of the directory server,
or the public certificate of the directory server's certificate authority. 
    --> I guess this is what we generated from OUD server and imported into wallet on DB server
8
SSL + SASL + Keystore Password
Connects to the directory, via an SSL link. The SSL connection is authenticated using 
either the trusted public certificate of the directory server 
(or the public certificate of the directory server's certificate authority), 
and the client's trusted public certificate (or the public certificate of the client's certificate authority), 
and the client's private key.
