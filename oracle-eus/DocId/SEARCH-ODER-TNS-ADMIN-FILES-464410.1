APPLIES TO:

Oracle Net Services - Version 9.2.0.2 to 11.2.0.4 [Release 9.2 to 11.2]
Generic UNIX
Note that this does not apply to Enterprise Manager which searches ORACLE_HOME/network/admin unless TNS_ADMIN is set.
GOAL

The goal of this document is to explain how Oracle Net searches for the configuration files listener.ora, sqlnet.ora, tnsnames.ora and cman.ora.

SOLUTION


Oracle Net Services configuration files are not always located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory. Depending on the file, Oracle Net uses a different search order to locate the file.


Search order for the sqlnet.ora

    1. The directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable, if set.
    2. The $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory. 
    3.  In RAC, the sqlnet.ora file referenced by the instance would be in RDBMS_HOME/network/admin and NOT the GRID_HOME/network/admin.

 

Search order for the cman.ora, listener.ora, and tnsnames.ora

    1. The directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable, if set.
    2. One of the following directories: 
        On Solaris:
              /var/opt/oracle
        On other platforms: 
             /etc 
    3. The $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory.


Search order for ldap.ora

      Refer Note 363283.1

If TNS_ADMIN is set at the system level, that is the  ONLY location that will be searched.
