Alternative Solution

If patch 19285025 cannot be applied (whatever the reason may be), then there is an alternative solution.  Although not recommended, the alternative solution is to re-enable SSLv3 in the JVM that's hosting OUD.  The following site provides links to the Release Notes for the various major Java versions where instructions to re-enable SSLv3 can be found...

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/cve-2014-3566-2342133.html

Referencing the Java 7 update 75 Release Notes...

7u75 Update Release Notes
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u75-relnotes-2389086.html

here is the relevant excerpt...

SSLv3 is disabled by default

Starting with JDK 7u75 release, the SSLv3 protocol (Secure Socket Layer) has been deactivated and is not available by default. See the java.security.Security property jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms in <JRE_HOME>/lib/security/java.security file.

If SSLv3 is absolutely required, the protocol can be reactivated by removing "SSLv3" from the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property in the java.security file or by dynamically setting this Security property to "true" before JSSE is initialized.

It should be noted that SSLv3 is obsolete and should no longer be used.

Here are the high level steps to re-enable SSLv3 for OUD...

1. Stop OUD instance(s)
2. Make the necessary change to Java as instructed in the release notes
3. Start OUD instance(s)
4. Test EUS authentication
