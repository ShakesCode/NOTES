APPLIES TO:

Oracle Unified Directory - Version 11.1.2.0.0 and later
Information in this document applies to any platform.
SYMPTOMS

Users imported to OUD R2 from ldif are unable to authenticate to SQL*Plus db via LDAP (using OUD and EUS). Users created with ODSM can authenticate successfully.

The authentication failure can throw the following error in the Oracle db client:

Error information for ORA-1017 during Key Encryption:
Logon user       : MYDBUSER
ZT Code Error    : Generic Error Code
KZLD is doing LDAP unbind 


CAUSE

OUD R2 with EUS support configured will add the orcluser and orcluserv2 objectclasses when an LDAP user first tries to authenticate to the db. If those objectclasses already exist, as could be the case when users are created from an ldif import, they will be ignored by the EUS workflow element in OUD. Those users will be unable to authenticate.

This behavior has been logged as bug 16490835 and is fixed in version 11.1.2.1.0 and later.

SOLUTION

 As a workaround, make sure that any user objects imported from ldif do not contain the orcluser and orcluserv2 objectclasses.
