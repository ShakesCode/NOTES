DETAILS

Oracle Enterprise User Security Concepts and Overview







Enterprise User Security(EUS) simplifies user management by enabling database user accounts to be centrally managed in an LDAP compliant directory.  EUS enables you to address the administrative and security challenges for a large number of enterprise database users accessing multiple databases. EUS was introduced for the first time in Oracle RDBMS 8i and since then every new version enhanced it. To see what were the new features introduced in various releases see Note 165859.1.

Enterprise User Security relies on the Oracle Identity Management infrastructure. Third party directories can be used  if they are synchronized with OID or integrated with OVD. The OVD-EUS integration allows customers to manage all of the directory data required for EUS within the existing enterprise LDAP directory. Note 166937.1 shows what LDAP compliant directories can be used for EUS in various Oracle RDBMS releases. 


Besides the intrinsic single password authentication capabilities, EUS provides single sign-on(SSO) support for multiple databases if it is used in combination with strong authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or SSL.


 

Oracle Enterprise User Security Installation

To be able to use EUS one must first install Oracle Internet Directory or Oracle Virtual Directory and then register a database to the directory. The following two notes group together the most important notes related to OID/OVD installation: 

Note 1272055.1 - Master Note for Oracle Identity Manager 11g Install and Initial Setup Issues
Note 1272061.1 - Master Note for Oracle Identity Manager 9.x Installation and Setup Issues

The process of registering a database to a directory is explained in the documentation.

Oracle Enterprise User Security Licensing


Usage of Enterprise User Security with Oracle Database strong authentication (PKI, Kerberos) or password-based authentication,  no longer requires Oracle Advanced Security to be licensed.

Enterprise User Security is an Enterprise Edition (EE) feature for directory-based management of database users. It does require a corresponding Oracle Identity Management Directory Services Plus to be licensed. Any Oracle Advanced Security licenses purchased on or before January 31, 2004, have restricted use of the Oracle Internet Directory (OID) to support enterprise user security.

Oracle Advanced Security option is not required when configuring wallets to secure communication between the Oracle database and Oracle Internet Directory as part of the Enterprise User Security feature of Oracle Database
