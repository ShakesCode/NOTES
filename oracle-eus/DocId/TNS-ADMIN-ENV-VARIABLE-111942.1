Setting the TNS_ADMIN environment variable

From Oracle9i (9.x) onwards, Oracle Net Services is the current name for the
Oracle Networking product, formerly known as; SQL*Net in Oracle7 (7.x), Net8
in Oracle8 (8.0.x) and Net8i in Oracle8 (8.1.x). For consistency, the term
Oracle Net is used thoughout and refers to all Oracle Net product versions.

The TNS_ADMIN parameter/environment variable is used to explicity define the
directory location for Oracle Net to resolve where to find its configuration
files. TNS_ADMIN over-rides the default Oracle Net location.

For example, if TNS_ADMIN is set to ORACLE_HOME\test\admin, Oracle Net looks
for its configuration files in ORACLE_HOME\test\admin to make a database
connection or start other Oracle Networking products such as; the Listener,
Connection Manager, Names Server, etc.

TNS_ADMIN can be defined in the following ways:

=====================================================================
Platform  Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

WINDOWS

  Registry:

          Access the Windows registry i.e. click: Start > Run, then enter
          'Regedit.exe' (or 'Regedt32.exe'). Add the TNS_ADMIN environment
          variable to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Oracle[\Home[X]] key
          by right mouse clicking, then selecting: New > Key > String Value.
          Note: [X] is the Home Id for the ORACLE_HOME being modified.

          If you are unsure where to set TNS_ADMIN in the registry, refer to
          the ORACLE_HOME\bin\oracle.key file which provides the location of
          the registry key used by executables within that home.

          Setting TNS_ADMIN in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Oracle[\Home[X]]
          key over-rides the default Oracle Net location for products only
          installed into that ORACLE_HOME.

          By default, each time you install different Oracle versions, the
          default location to which Oracle Net files are generated is the
          ORACLE_HOME\network|net80\admin directory. Over time, these two (or
          more) sets of configuration files may start to contain differing
          information and entries.

          In this case, you may wish to set TNS_ADMIN in the environment rather
          than as a Home-specific registry entry (see below). This consolidates,
          centralises and aids administration of Oracle Net configuration
          files. However, be aware of syntactical differences and parameter
          behavioural changes between different SQL*Net/Net8/Net8i/Oracle Net
          versions.

          Be aware that some Oracle product combinations may require, or be 
          better suited to, maintaining Home-specific versions of Oracle Net
          configuration files. Examples include; Oracle Applications, Oracle
          9iAS, Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), etc. If using combinations 
          of these products, exercise care so not to accidentally modify
          the other ORACLE_HOMEs TNS_ADMIN location e.g. making a global change
          that adversely affects Oracle Net connectivity of other Oracle
          versions.

  Environment:

          TNS_ADMIN may also be defined as a system-wide or global variable
          within the operating system. To do so:

          1. Logon as Administrator.
          2. Click Start > Settings > Control Panel
          3. Double click the SYSTEM icon
          4. From System Properties, select Environment tab.

          The Environment tab lists System environment variables defined by
          Windows NT - these are the same no matter which user is logged on
          to the computer. When logged as as a member of the Administrator
          group, you can modify, add or delete values.

          5. Highlight OS in the list of Systems Variables

          In the Variable field you should see: OS and in the Value field,
          the value: Windows_NT
     
          6. Change the Variable from OS to TNS_ADMIN.
          7. Change the Value from Windows_NT to the complete path were the
             configuration files will reside.

             For example:  c:\orant\net80\admin

          8. Click Set, then apply.

          In the System Variable table you should now see the TNS_ADMIN
          variable with the path to the location of Oracle Net configuration
          files.

          9. Click OK to close window.

          This setting will force all installed Oracle applications run or
          launched from this server to use the same set of configuration files.

          Note: Again, care should be taken when setting global variables,
                particularly for multiple ORACLE_HOME environments. This action
                will modify other ORACLE_HOME's TNS_ADMIN locations and may
                adversely affect their ability to connect.

  Session:

          TNS_ADMIN may also be defined for a given Command Prompt session.
          For example:

          C:\> set tns_admin=c:\temp

          In this case, the value of TNS_ADMIN is only valid for the life of
          the Command Prompt session. Once terminated, the value is lost.


  TNS_ADMIN Resolution Order:

          On Windows NT/2000, the precedence in which Oracle Net
          Configuration files are resolved is:

          1. Oracle Net files in present working directory (PWD/CWD)
          2. TNS_ADMIN defined sessionally or by user-defined script
          3. TNS_ADMIN defined as a global environment variable
          4. TNS_ADMIN defined in the registry
          5. Oracle Net files in %ORACLE_HOME/network|net80\admin
             (Oracle default location)
           

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unix      Define the TNS_ADMIN environment variable using either 'setenv' or
          'export' commands i.e.

          For C/T/Z shells (csh, tcsh, zsh) use 'setenv' i.e.
          $ setenv TNS_ADMIN <directory>

            For example: 
            $ setenv TNS_ADMIN /opt/oracle

          For Korn/Bourne/Bash shells (ksh, sh, bash) use 'export' i.e.
          $ TNS_ADMIN=<path/directory>
          $ export TNS_ADMIN

            For example: 
            $ export TNS_ADMIN=/opt/oracle

          TNS_ADMIN may be made permanent in:
          - user's login scripts e.g. $HOME/.profile
          - environment setting scripts e.g. /usr/local/bin/oraenv | coraenv
          - system-wide e.g. /etc/profile or bash_profile

          Note: Again, care should be taken when setting global variables,
                particularly for multiple ORACLE_HOME environments. This action
                will modify other ORACLE_HOME's or users' TNS_ADMIN locations
                and may adversely affect their ability to connect.

  TNS_ADMIN Resolution Order:

          On Unix, the precedence in which Oracle Net Configuration files are
          resolved is:

          1. TNS_ADMIN defined as a global environment variable
          2. TNS_ADMIN defined sessionally or by user-defined script
          3. Oracle Net files in /var/opt/oracle (BSD derivitives)
             or
             /etc (SVR4 derivitives)
          4. Oracle Net files in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin (Oracle default)
