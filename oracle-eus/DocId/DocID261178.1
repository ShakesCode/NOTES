To assist with the debug of ORA-28030 errors

 
SCOPE & APPLICATION
-------------------

This document is relevant to anyone setting up EUS with either 8i or later target database. It assumes a basic knowledge of SSL and
Oracle tools such as Oracle Wallet Manager and Oracle Directory Manager.  


Enterprise User Security Configuration: Resolving ORA-28030 Errors
-----------------------------
 
What does the error mean?

ORA-28030 error indicate that the secure connection between the target database and the directory did not complete successfully. 
The connection is secured by using SSL.  To make successful enterprise user connection the database to directory configuration
must be configured for both client, (target database), and server (directory) authentication.  This means both need to have 
wallets with valid user certificates and shared trust points.  


How do you test the if the connection is configured correctly for SSL?

The simplest way to simulate what the target database does is to use ldapbind.  When the target database connects to the 
directory it need to authenticate using certificates.  When testing ldapbind we therefore need to use SSL certificates in a wallet 
and execute the command from the ORACLE HOME of the target database.  

$> ldapbind -h <oid_hostname> -p <SSL_port> -U 3 -W "file:<Wallet_path>" -P "<wallet_password>"

For example:

$> ldapbind -h  -p 636 -U 3 -W "file:/etc/oracle/wallets" -P "welcome1" 

The type of authentication is determined by the value of the -U flag and the SSL Authentication value of the LDAP server 
listening on the port - both have to match, i.e.

ldapbind -U 1 with the directory SSL Authentication configured to No SSL Authentication
ldapbind -U 2 with the directory SSL Authenticationconfigured to SSL Server Authentication
ldapbind -U 3 with the directory SSL Authentication configured to SSL Client Server Authentication

Run each of these inturn changing the SSL Authentication type on the directory to match the value of the the -U flag and 
restarting the directory server each time you change the value.


How do you change the SSL Authentication type in a directory?

To use EUS Oracle recommends that you configure a separate SSL configset, i.e. do not use the Default Configuration Set.  The 
configuration set are configured in the directory information tree, DIT, in Oracle Directory Manager, ODM. The configset are 
under the Server Management entry.  If you only have a Default Configuration Set, create a new one using the Create Like button 
and then changing both the Non SSL Port and SSL Port to unique values. To change the SSL Port under the SSL Setting Tab you will 
need to tick the SSL Enable box.

The value of SSL Authentication for the configuration set is set from the SSL Setting tab of you Configuration Set.  For any 
value other than "No Authentication" a wallet will be required.  The format of the wallet universal resource locator, URL, is 
file:<directory>.  The actual file is not specified.

Each time the value of the SSL Authentication is changed the Apply button must be selected and the server restarted.  If the 
configuration set is Set1 and already had the default configuration set running then the server would be restarted using:

$> Only for pre-10g OID :odictl server=oidldapd instance=2 configset=1
Post 10g you need to restart oid using opmnctl
 

How do I create a wallet?

The Oracle SSL certificate store is called a Wallet. A wallet is a PKCS#12 certificate store.  Oracle wallets as administrated via 
Oracle Wallet Manager, OWM.  The details of wallet creation are outside the scope of this note but to use a wallet with EUS the 
wallet must have a READY user certificate which has a subject which matches the RDBMS_SERVER_DN of the target database and must be 
marked as READY under the User Certifcate store in OWM.  OWM supports certficates from most commercial certificate authorities or 
from Oracle's own authority which is part of the 10g iAS release.  It is also possible to use self signed certificates using 
openssl.


Testing using ldapbind.

If ldapbind with -U 1 fails then this suggests one of the following:

1. There is no directory server listening on the specified host and port.
2. The diredtory server is not configured for No Authentication
3. The directory server has not been restarted since it was set for No Authentication
4. The local wallet does not exit.

If ldapbind with -U 2 fails then this suggests one of the following:

1. The directory server is not configured for SSL Server Authentication
2. The directory server has not been restarted since it was set for SSL Server Authentication
3. The password provided for the local wallet is incorrect
4. The local wallet does not contain the complete signing certifcate chain of the directories user certificate
5. The directory wallet located in the configuration set is incorrect or does not point to an open wallet
6. The directories certificate "valid from" or "vaild to" dates are incorrect.

If ldapbind with -U 3 fails then this suggests one of the following:

1. The directory server is not configured for SSL Client Server Authentication
2. The directory server has not been restarted since it was set for SSL Client Server Authentication
3. The certficate located in the configuration set is incorrect or does not point to an open wallet
4. The directories wallet does not contain the complete signing certifcate chain of the database user certificate
5. The database has not been registered with the directory an therefore there is no entry in the directory which matches the 
RDBMS_SERVER_DN.
6. The databases certificate "valid from" or "vaild to" dates are incorrect.

What if the ldapbind's all work but actual connections still fail with the ORA-28030 error?

If the ldapbind -U 3 works from the target database Oracle Home then the problem could be that the database is 
not accessing identical information to the ldapbind.  The ldapbind gets the location of the wallet from the 
-W flag and the password to open the wallet from the -p flag.  The location of the SSL port and host from 
the other flags.  As this information has to be determined by the database when it attempts to connect to the 
directory then you need to ensure that the ldap.ora states the correct host and ssl port and that the 
sqlnet.ora correctly locates the wallet.  You also need to ensure that the wallet is set to auto login as 
the database does not have the password.  In the case of Microsoft Windows the database service must run as 
the use who created the wallet.

e.g.

ldap.ora

DEFAULT_ADMIN_CONTEXT = "dc=oracle,dc=com"
DIRECTORY_SERVERS= (iballant-pc:389:636)
DIRECTORY_SERVER_TYPE = OID

sqlnet.ora

WALLET_LOCATION =
  (SOURCE =
    (METHOD = FILE)
    (METHOD_DATA =
      (DIRECTORY = c:\oracle\wallets)
    )
  )

Terminology:

Target Database: The database to which the client is connecting with a application. e.g. sqlplus
Directory: The LDAP compliant directory.
