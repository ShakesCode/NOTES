SYMPTOMS

Attempting to set a TNS_ADMIN environment variable for a SCAN listener fails with the following errors:

srvctl setenv listener -l listener_scan1 -T TNS_ADMIN=$TNS_ADMIN


PRKO-3162 : The actions setenv, getenv, and unsetenv are not supported for Single Client Access Name listener listener_scan1
PRCN-2066 : Failed to retrieve cluster listener for listener_scan1 because it has the type of Single Client Access Name Listener

 

CAUSE

By intentional design, srvctl getenv/setenv commands are only allowed for non-SCAN listeners in order to avoid potential user error of setting TNS_ADMIN environment variable to locations outside of the CRS HOME.  The only supported location for these Net files for SCAN listeners is: <CRS home>/network/admin.

SOLUTION

Avoid the use of srvct getenv/setenv commands (for example for setting TNS_ADMIN variable) for SCAN listeners
