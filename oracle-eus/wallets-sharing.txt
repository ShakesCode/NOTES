============
IN PRACTICE
============
Set TNS_ADMIN, ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_BASE environment variables for the DB using setenv command and start DB using srvctl.
Or, set those env vars in the OS and start DB using sqlplus.
At that time, sqlnet.ora should be in $TNS_ADMIN 
- and it need not have the wallet location - location will be taken from default ones - see below docs and extract of the docs

EXXEPTION - WHEN SSL AUTHENTICATION IS USED BETWEEN USER AND DB

----------------
ALSO, IN 12C DB
----------------
If wallet has 11g DB wallet locations, then 12c does not like them - therefore, better use default locations for both 11g and 12c

ORACLE DOCS THAT TALK OF THAT

Sharing Wallets and sqlnet.ora Files Among Multiple Databases
Multiple databases (that are not replicas) cannot share wallets, because wallets contain a database's identity. 
Therefore, if a sqlnet.ora file contains a wallet location, then multiple databases cannot share that sqlnet.ora file.

In order to share a single sqlnet.ora file among multiple databases, the following preconditions are required:

User authentication should use passwords or Kerberos.

The wallet containing the password should reside at the default wallet location, which is where Database Configuration Assistant 
creates it.

If the preceding conditions are met, then multiple databases can share the sqlnet.ora file because no wallet location information is stored in that file.

However, when SSL authentication is used between the user (client) and the database, the wallet location must be specified in the database server's sqlnet.ora file. 
Such a sqlnet.ora file cannot be shared by multiple databases for SSL-authenticated enterprise users.
