    THE SERVER
    http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-server.html
      postgresql95-server - The programs needed to create and run a PostgreSQL server
      PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS).
      The postgresql95-server package contains the programs needed to create
      and run a PostgreSQL server, which will in turn allow you to create
      and maintain PostgreSQL databases.
    
    CLIENT
    http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95.html
      postgresql95 - PostgreSQL client programs and libraries
      PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS).
      The base postgresql package contains the client programs that you'll need to
      access a PostgreSQL DBMS server, as well as HTML documentation for the whole
      system.  These client programs can be located on the same machine as the
      PostgreSQL server, or on a remote machine that accesses a PostgreSQL server
      over a network connection.  The PostgreSQL server can be found in the
      postgresql95-server sub-package.
      
      If you want to manipulate a PostgreSQL database on a local or remote PostgreSQL
      server, you need this package. You also need to install this package
      if you're installing the postgresql95-server package.
    
    EXTENSION MODULES
    http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-contrib.html

    http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-libs.html
      postgresql95-libs - The shared libraries required for any PostgreSQL clients
      The postgresql95-libs package provides the essential shared libraries for any
      PostgreSQL client program or interface. You will need to install this package
      to use any other PostgreSQL package or any clients that need to connect to a
      PostgreSQL server.
  
PL-PERL
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-plperl.html
  The postgresql95-plperl package contains the PL/Perl procedural language,
  which is an extension to the PostgreSQL database server.
  Install this if you want to write database functions in Perl.

http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-plpython.html

PL-TCL
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-pltcl.html
  PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management
  system. The postgresql95-pltcl package contains the PL/Tcl language
  for the backend.

BACKUP/RECOVERY
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/barman.html
  Barman (backup and recovery manager) is an administration tool for disaster
  recovery of PostgreSQL servers written in Python. Barman can perform remote
  backups of multiple servers in business critical environments, and helps DBAs
  during the recovery phase.
  
  Barmanâ€™s most wanted features include: backup catalogues, incremental backup,
  retention policies, remote recovery, archiving and compression of WAL files
  and of backups. Barman is written and maintained by PostgreSQL professionals
  2ndQuadrant.
  
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/pgespresso95.html
  pgespresso is an extension that adds functions and views to be used by Barman,
  the disaster recovery tool written by 2ndQuadrant and released as open source
  (http://www.pgbarman.org/). Requires at least Barman 1.3.1 and PostgreSQL 9.2.
  
REPLICATION
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/repmgr95.html
  repmgr is an open-source tool suite to manage replication and failover in a
  cluster of PostgreSQL servers. It enhances PostgreSQL's built-in hot-standby
  capabilities with tools to set up standby servers, monitor replication, and
  perform administrative tasks such as failover or manual switchover operations.
  
  repmgr has provided advanced support for PostgreSQL's built-in replication
  mechanisms since they were introduced in 9.0, and repmgr 2.0 supports all
  PostgreSQL versions from 9.0 to 9.5. With further developments in replication
  functionality such as cascading replication, timeline switching and base
  backups via the replication protocol, the repmgr team has decided to use
  PostgreSQL 9.3 as the baseline version for repmgr 3.0, which is a substantial
  rewrite of the existing repmgr code and which will be developed to support
  future PostgreSQL versions.
  
SHARDING
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/citus_95.html
  Citus horizontally scales PostgreSQL across commodity servers
  using sharding and replication. Its query engine parallelizes
  incoming SQL queries across these servers to enable real-time
  responses on large datasets.
  
  Citus extends the underlying database rather than forking it,
  which gives developers and enterprises the power and familiarity
  of a traditional relational database. As an extension, Citus
  supports new PostgreSQL releases, allowing users to benefit from
  new features while maintaining compatibility with existing
  PostgreSQL tools. Note that Citus supports many (but not all) SQL
  commands
  
CONNECTION POOLING
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/pgpool-II-95.html
  pgpool-II is a inherited project of pgpool (to classify from
  pgpool-II, it is sometimes called as pgpool-I). For those of
  you not familiar with pgpool-I, it is a multi-functional
  middle ware for PostgreSQL that features connection pooling,
  replication and load balancing functions. pgpool-I allows a
  user to connect at most two PostgreSQL servers for higher
  availability or for higher search performance compared to a
  single PostgreSQL server.
  
  pgpool-II, on the other hand, allows multiple PostgreSQL
  servers (DB nodes) to be connected, which enables queries
  to be executed simultaneously on all servers. In other words,
  it enables "parallel query" processing. Also, pgpool-II can
  be started as pgpool-I by changing configuration parameters.
  pgpool-II that is executed in pgpool-I mode enables multiple
  DB nodes to be connected, which was not possible in pgpool-I.

LOGFILE ANALYZER
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/pgbadger.html
  pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer build for speed with fully
  detailed reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small
  Perl script that aims to replace and outperform the old php script
  pgFouine.
  
  pgBadger is written in pure Perl language. It uses a javascript library
  to draw graphs so that you don't need additional Perl modules or any
  other package to install. Furthermore, this library gives us more
  features such as zooming.
  
  pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr or
  csvlog). It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip
  compressed file.
  
ORACLE TO PG SCHEMA CONVERTOR
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/ora2pg.html
  This package contains a Perl module and a companion script to convert an
  Oracle database schema to PostgreSQL and to migrate the data from an
  Oracle database to a PostgreSQL database.

EVENT NOTIFIER
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/compat-libevent14.html
  The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
  when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
  has been reached. libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event
  loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs
  to call event_dispatch() and can then add or remove events dynamically
  without having to change the event loop.
  
ODBC DRIVER
http://yum.postgresql.org/9.5/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/repoview/postgresql95-odbc.html
  This package includes the driver needed for applications to access a
  PostgreSQL system via ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).

JDBC DRIVER
