Oracle SQL Developer 4.0.1.14 surely does support connections to PostgreSQL.

download JDBC driver for Postgres (http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)
in SQL Developer go to Tools → Preferences, Database → Third Party JDBC Drivers and add the jar file 
(see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/migration/jdbc-migration-1923524.html for step by step example)

Now just make a new Database Connection and instead of Oracle, select PostgreSQL tab

--> Give connection a name
    Give username and password
    Give the hostname where Postgres is running
     CAUTION NOTE:
        If you just give the hostname, then it will expect a database with same name as the username to exist in Postgres.
        However, we dont really want to do that!
        Therefore, in 'hostname' field, give <hostname>:<port>/<dbname>? (dont forget the question mark)
        Example:  pgserver0001:5432/postgres?   (preferred - as 'postgres' database always exists)
                  pgserver0001:5432/appdb?   
    
    Verify the port and change if needed (port is still necessary though we gave the port number in hostname)

    Click 'choose database' to choose a database to which the user has access 
        --> it will connect to Postgres server and get the DB list
    Choose the DB you want to work on
