Oracle SQL Developer 4.0.1.14 surely does support connections to PostgreSQL.

download JDBC driver for Postgres (http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)
in SQL Developer go to Tools → Preferences, Database → Third Party JDBC Drivers and add the jar file 
(see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/migration/jdbc-migration-1923524.html for step by step example)

Now just make a new Database Connection and instead of Oracle, select PostgreSQL tab

--> Give connection a name
    Give username and password
    Give the hostname where Postgres is running
    Verify the port and change if needed
    Click 'choose database' to choose a database to which the user has access --> it will connect to Postgres server and get the DB list
    Choose the DB you want to work on
