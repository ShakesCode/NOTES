b. Engine Performance
c. New features

Upgrade Method
> Major upgrades in-place: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/pgupgrade.html
> Major upgrades minimum downtime: http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/progress-online-upgrade/
      --> newly developed 'logical replication solution' which is online with minimum downtime
> Primary and standby should be on same version

- Patching / Upgardes -same
      How long does a version remain in support - about 5 years by postgres community

- Procedural langugage
      - Oracle Dev can use PL pgSQL - 
      - SQL Server stored procs (T-SQL) - No direct path, requires to re-write the code

- Demo of config Master /Slave
--> how to identify which is primary (product 'repmgr')
--> witness process/server

- Larger databases (muti TB) - things to take care of


III. Demo of config Master /Slave (Raj)
 - repmgr (master/standby replication manager) http://www.repmgr.org/

IV. What are PostgreSQL extensions? How can they be leveraged in an enterprise environment? Safe?

- Postgres plugins with additional features
Eg. pg_buffer_cache

- Extensions devloped by 3rd party (distributed independently from PostgreSQL)
Eg. Auditng extn 

- Shud we write our own extensions? Why?
Eg. Can create simple-to-use custom extension as Plugin in postgres
For other more complicated extensions (Example. pg_
bbasic extension information: uffercache  are complied plugin), can talk to experts.

V. Larger databsaes
Memory
Logical dumps will become large
Physical backup is better
Partitioning - not many options in Postgres
      Clients with large DB's also are not using partitioning much
      Implement partitioning on our own
      PK must be part of partioning key

More1:
I. Postgres Transactions and concurrency controls
II. Postgres Server Monitoring
III. Data Compliance (SOX, HIPPA etc.)

More2:
I. Postgres Enterprise Manager 
II. Planning for common errors we receive in postgres database
III. can u explain the difference between: UPDATES vs HOT_UPDATES
To be covered at the last:
- Summarize the potential pitfals and problem areas usually encountered in production systems that we need to keep a tab on
- Compoenents/events that have to be monitored in postgresql. Does it provide any tools to enable monitoring events?
- Certificates for this course attendance as we asked for earlier.
