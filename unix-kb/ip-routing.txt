========================================================
WHICH IP IS MY HOST USING FOR OUTBOUND CONNECTIONS
========================================================
Just 'ping' does not show which IP of the host is being used for pinging/connecting to other servers.
Use 'ping -I interface outsidehost' --> example 'ping -I eth0 outsidehost1'

Try each interface and you will know which interface and IP the host uses.

Steps are given below.

-----------------------------
LIST THE HOSTNAME AND ITS IP 
-----------------------------
NOTE:  this may not be the IP that is used by outbound (see ip route list step further below)

# hostname
myhost1

# nslookup myhost1
110.198.193.13

# ip route list

default via 101.166.140.1 dev bondeth0 --> NOTE THAT THIS IS USED FOR OUTBOUND
110.166.140.0/23 dev bondeth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 110.166.140.96 --> THAT MEANS, THIS IS USED FOR OUTBOUND 
110.198.192.0/23 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 110.198.193.13 --> NOT THIS

Further Edit: You might try using the newest IP management tools in Debian, iproute 2. (Secondary link) It looks like something along the lines of 
Bringin up the interface: ip link set eth0 up
ip addr add 192.168.0.2/24 dev ethe0
ip addr add 192.168.0.3/24 dev eth0

Then setting up the routing table with
ip route add 10.0.0.0/16 via 192.168.0.2
