LIST PACKAGES THAT DEPEND ON A PACKAGE
repoquery --whatrequires --installed --recursive package_name 
(can probably add --alldeps to repoquery - which also seems like default)
rpm -q --whatrequires package_name

Example:
# repoquery --whatrequires --installed --recursive rsyslogd
< returns nothing - so nothing depends upon rsyslogd >

# rpm -q --whatrequires rsyslogd 
no package requires rsyslogd

LIST WHAT A PACKAGE DEPENDS UPON
yum deplist

# yum deplist rsyslogd
Finding dependencies: 

LIST DEPENDENCIES FOR A PACKAGE

yum info <package> does not show dependencies
yum doesn't have that capability. Use the repoquery tool from the yum-utils package instead.

repoquery --requires <package>
OR to also see which additional RPM packages are needed to satisfy the dependencies, use --resolve

repoquery --requires --resolve <package>

Example:
# repoquery --requires rsyslogd

# repoquery --requires --resolve rsyslogd
