    This is from the above site:
    The first time I tried it, because we didn’t run a vgexport on the primary server 
    (you wouldn’t have the chance to do that in a crash situation),
    
    I had to vgexport the volume groups, then vgimport and vgchange them, then mount the filesystems.  
    But I discovered, that if you add the same entries to /etc/fstab for the logical volumes on the backup server, 
    that you do not have to run any lvm steps like vgexport, vgimport, or vgchange, the OS does all of that automatically.  
    And if you boot the backup server when its not connected to the disk array, it just fails trying to mount those drives 
    but it doesn’t keep the O.S. from starting up.
    
    So the net of all of this is if we have a hardware failure on our database server we can have it back up and 
    running on a secondary server in less then 5 minutes, unless it has to do an fsck on the filesystems.
