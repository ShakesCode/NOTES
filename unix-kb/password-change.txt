1. To set passwords for users from the command line, type:

# chpasswd
Followed by entering username:password pairs, one pair per line. Enter CTRL+D when finished.

user1:passwd1
user2:passwd2
CTRL+D

2. To set passwords for users contained in a file named mypwdfile, type the following:

# cat mypwdfile | chpasswd
Note that mypwdfile must contain username:password pairs; one pair per line. For example:

user1:passwd1
user2:passwd2
...

3. To use another encryption method:

# chpasswd -ec MD5
Now MD5 encrypted passwords must be given.

Method2:
Use this script:
#!/usr/local/bin/expect -f 
set username $env(UNAME) 
set password $env(UPASS) 
spawn passwd $username 
expect "New password:" 
send "$password\r" 
expect "Re-enter new password:" 
send "$password\r" 
send "exit\r" 
expect eof
