Use /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7 command on a terminal shell to figure out where is your java 1.7 home directory

$ /usr/libexec/java_home       
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home

Set Java home with that:
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home
