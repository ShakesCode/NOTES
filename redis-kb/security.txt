Securing Redis
By default Redis binds to all the interfaces and has no authentication at all. If you use Redis into a very controlled
environment, separated from the external internet and in general from attackers, that's fine. However if Redis without 
any hardening is exposed to the internet, it is a big security concern. If you are not 100% sure your environment is secured 
properly, please check the following steps in order to make Redis more secure, which are enlisted in order of increased security.
Make sure the port Redis uses to listen for connections (by default 6379 and additionally 16379 if you run Redis in cluster
mode, plus 26379 for Sentinel) is firewalled, so that it is not possible to contact Redis from the outside world.
Use a configuration file where the bind directive is set in order to guarantee that Redis listens just in as little network
interfaces you are using. For example only the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) if you are accessing Redis just locally from 
the same computer, and so forth.
Use the requirepass option in order to add an additional layer of security so that clients will require to authenticate using
the AUTH command.
Use spiped or another SSL tunnelling software in order to encrypt traffic between Redis servers and Redis clients if your
environment requires encryption.
Note that a Redis exposed to the internet without any security is very simple to exploit, so make sure you understand the
above and apply at least a firewalling layer. After the firewalling is in place, try to connect with redis-cli from an
external host in order to prove yourself the instance is actually not reachable.
