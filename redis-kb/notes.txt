Cluster - both master and slave are writeable
--> Data written to slave is replicated back to master 
--> cluster needs min 3 masters - so data is sharded at least 3-ways

Replication - usually master is writeable, slave is read-only BY DEFAULT - IT CAN BE MADE WRITEABLE (https://redis.io/topics/replication)
--> writeable slaves DO NOT REPLICATE BACK TO MASTER
--> writeable slaves DO NOT REPLICATE WRITES TO SUB-SLAVES
--> upon restart of writeable-slave, data written to it is lost as it is not replicated to master or other slaves (test this)

Commands can be disabled my masking them
--> using rename-command directive.
