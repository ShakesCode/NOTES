REDIS ON OPENSTACK DESIGN

One Redis-VM with one instance per request

•	Request for new Redis instance (client)
•	Request received at Redis-Provision server (RPS)
•	RPS will invoke Terraform to create a new VM
•	RPS records the request in a file/table
•	Terraform creates a new VM, assigns IP, invokes chef-bootstrap
•	Chef on VM creates a Redis instance, changes its password
•	Chef sends completion and credential to RPS file/table
o	Invokes a URL at RPS which will append to a file/table
•	RPS reads the table/file and sends mail to requesor


Components
Client – http request to RPS
RPS – http server like Sinatra or Python
Request – requestor name, LAN Id, Blossom Project, VM flavor (does not wait for final email)
RPS response – ‘request received, you will get an email when completed’
RPS email notification – IP, Port, Password – asynchronous with the request
RPS file/table – can be a file appended by Sinatra/Python http server
Terraform – needs NUID and keypair for the OST server-tenant

Question – how do we plug-in a AD group here for authorized requestors?


RPS methods
GET – get vm details – for a blossom id 
POST – create new redis vm

Sinatra
