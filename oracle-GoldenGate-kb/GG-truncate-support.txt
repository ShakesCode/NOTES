GoldenGate TRUNCATE Support

Oracle GoldenGate supports the DDL TRUNCATE statement. There are two, mutually exclusive options:

Standalone TRUNCATE support. This supports the TRUNCATE TABLE statement, but does not support truncation of table partitioning. It is controlled by the GETTRUNCATES parameter and is discussed in this page.

Full DDL support. This includes support for TRUNCATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE TRUNCATE PARTITION. It is controlled by the DDL parameter and is out of scope for this page.

Standalone TRUNCATE Support

Presumably stand-alone support for the TRUNCATE statement was added before full DDL support was introduced.

By default TRUNCATE commands are ignored by both the extract and replicat processes. To configure stand-alone TRUNCATE support, the GETTRUNCATES parameter must be added to the parameters of the extract, data pump and replicat processes.

Note that the GETTRUNCATES parameter must appear in the parameter file BEFORE the TABLE parameter for extract processes and BEFORE the MAP parameter for replicat processes. If the GETTRUNCATES parameter appears after the TABLE/MAP parameters it will be ignored for those tables.
