TO SWITCH BETWEEN EXTRACT METHODS FOR THE SAME PAIR OF DB'S AND TABLE-SETS

•	Stop OMS app AND/OR Quiese DB
o	If quiese can do what is required, we don’t need to stop OMS DB
•	Wait for DB to be fully quiesed (check how)
•	Do a log-switch 
•	Note down SCN at OMS
•	Note down SCN at ODS
•	Stop current extract
•	Start new extract, pump, replicate starting at that SCN we noted
•	Unquiese the DB

About quiese:
Quiesce	In this mode all users transactions are allowed to complete, once completed the user is unable to perform any DML/DDL commands (their sessions appear to freeze) but remain connected to the database. Users will be allowed to login but the session will again appear to freeze.DBA’s can perform any DML/DDL as normal, their sessions are unaffected, this also applies to users with the restricted session privilege.

	This says ” You can switch between the modes with some configuration changes”


Following two talk about moving (upgrading) from Integrated to Classic without redoing initial re-exp/imp of data:  (change this as necessary for our situation)

	Talks about RBA, SCN etc
