INSTANCE CRASH
===============
SEE ALSO - other doc in this repository - or merge this and that

Keep 'dir*' and BR directories in a location shared between cluster nodes

Test1 - Stop all processes and MGR process on one node
Start them on the other node
--> Upon starting MGR process on one node, with shared folder for 'dir*' and 'BR' (except dirjar and dirwww)
--> MGR and other processes started in ALL NODES of cluster ---->>>> is this the expected behaviour?
--> Inserts done on either node propagated well to destination
--> CHECK - is this behaviour expected

Test2 - Stop an instance
Though MGR and other processes were in RUNNING state on both nodes, stop of one instance 
killed the processes connected to that instance on the respective node
--> Due to restart specified in MGR parameters, they restarted in both nodes sometime later 
      - due to remaining running instance
      
-----> REDO - RE-DO THIS - THIS IS UNCLEAR ABOVE WHETHER STOPPING THE INSTANCE STOPPED PROCESSES IN BOTH NODES


===========================
SITE SWITCHOVER - SOURCE DB  - INCOMPLETE, MAY NEED REDO
===========================
On the switched over side, did the following:

>Copy the parameter files -
Copy all three - extract, pump and replicat
If they are stored in a central location "across clusters" - then no copy is needed

>Create userid alias: (this uses already created user, and just  creates an alias for that)
ggsci> Alter CredentialStore Add User ogguser@TNS_ALIAS_SOURCE Password password Alias ogguser_src


-----
NOTE: TNS_ALIAS_SOURCE is the tns entry at the switched-over side - which may reference a different db-unique-name
-----

Verify login:
ggsci> dblogin useridalias ogguser_src
