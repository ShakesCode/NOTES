        20.13 Restarting a Primary Extract after System Failure or Corruption

>Dest replicat - Login to DB in GGSCI
ggsci> DBLOGIN {USERID Replicat_user | USERIDALIAS alias_of_Replicat_user}
ggsci>  dblogin useridalias ogguserigowad

>Dest replicat - obtain the LOGBSN value

ggsci> info replicat rigowa, detail

This showed:
    Current Log BSN value: (no data)  --> QUESTION- why is it not showing a number here (sometimes it shows)
    
    Integrated Replicat low watermark: 15630999
    (All source transactions prior to this scn have been applied)
    
    Integrated Replicat high watermark: 15631139
    (Some source transactions between this scn and the low watermark may have been applied)

--> Get a BSN value - not sure why it is showing as 'no data' above

However, used one that I had found in an earlier test - 15620123

>Source extract 

ggsci> stop extract eigowa
ggsci> dblogin useridalias ogguserigowas
ggsci> alter extract eigowa SCN 15620123 (the bsn found from replicat)
ggsci> alter extract eigowa ETROLLOVER

    2015-09-04 02:25:30  INFO    OGG-01520  Rollover performed.  For each affected output trail of Version 10 or higher
    format, after starting the source extract, issue ALTER EXTSEQNO for that trail's reader (either pump EXTRACT or REPLICAT)
    to move the reader's scan to the new trail file;  it will not happen automatically.
    EXTRACT altered.    

ggsci> info extract eigowa showch

In the output, look for the following:
  Current Checkpoint (current write position):
    Sequence #: 6
    RBA: 0

>Source pump

ggsci> alter extract pigowa extseqno 6  (the sequence number got from extract above)
ggsci> alter extract pigowa extrba 0
ggsci> alter extract pigowa etrollover

    EXTRACT altered.

Remove/rename an extract-trail file and recover it 
INCORRECT? - https://community.oracle.com/thread/2240337?tstart=0:  alter extract <extract_name>, extseqno n

Break: Renamed dirdat/ec000004
Fix: (potential - still not working well)
ggsci> stop ec1  --> the extract process on the source side
ggsci> alter extract ec1  extseqno 4, thread 1
ggsci> alter extract ec1  extseqno 4, thread 2

This gave this error in ggserror.log: 
Failed to open target trail file ./dirdat/ec000004, at RBA 11834.

Then 'touched' an empty file ec000004, and restarted extract ec1.
That gave this error:
Expected 4 bytes, but got 0 bytes, in trail ./dirdat/ec000004

Then moved the renamed file back to its original name ec000004.
That gave the following messages:
    2015-07-06 08:55:14  INFO    OGG-00993  Oracle GoldenGate Capture for Oracle, ec1.prm:  EXTRACT EC1 started.

    input trail file ./dirdat/ec000004, which is not marked as complete; 
    but succeeding trail file ./dirdat/ec000005 exists. 
    If ALTER ETROLLOVER has been performed on source extract, 
    ALTER EXTSEQNO must be performed on each corresponding downstream reader.

Also, extract had proceeded to many more trail files.
So, did this:  Set the sequence number to the next file of the last file
ggsci> alter extract ec1, extseqno 22, thread 1
EXTRACT altered.

ggsci> alter extract ec1, extseqno 22, thread 2
EXTRACT altered.

This also did not help: that is, more changes to data did not propagate

Finally, had do a sort of 'resetlogs':
    ggsci> dblogin useridalias oggusersc
    ggsci> register extract ec1 database
    Extract EC1 successfully registered with database at SCN 1328963.

    ggsci> add extract ec1, tranlog, threads 2, begin now 
    EXTRACT added.
