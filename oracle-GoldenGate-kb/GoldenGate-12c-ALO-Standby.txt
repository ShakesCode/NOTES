CONFIGURE GG PROCESSES - MGR, EXTRACT, PUMP, REPLICATE
==============================================================

>> Source Standby - Configure mgr process
NOTE: Trailfiles can have only two-letter prefix.  So, e1 for extract1 is used here (or 'in' as in Orcle integrated tutorial)
NOTE: This 'modification' is not necessary - actually it can hamper work of multiple ext processes on same server - Tutorial said ./dirdat/* --> now modified to match with exttrail 'in'
CHECK- What should be purgeoldextracts policy - * or something else
CHECK- Minkeephours or minimum logs to keep
CHECK- Autostart extract or not
CHECK- Autostart only some extracts or all

    $ ggsci
    ggsci> edit param mgr
      PORT 7809
      DynamicPortList 20000-20099
      PurgeOldExtracts ./dirdat/*, UseCheckPoints, MinKeepHours 2

      AUTORESTART Extract *, WaitMinutes 1, Retries 3  
      << save with :wq if editor was vi >>
    ggsci> stop mgr
    ggsci> start mgr
    
>> Source Primary - Setup TRANDATA (new in 12c)
This is further to setting up supplemental logging. Before you can start capturing real-time data, 
the Oracle database must be set to log the table key values whenever it logs a rows change, 
so that they are available to Oracle GoldenGate in Redo. By default, the database logs only those column 
values that change. This is required so Oracle GoldenGate can locate the correct row on the target 
for update and delete operations.
NOTE:  This can be done for all tables, specific tables, all columns, specific columns
CHECK- should we do it for ALLCOLS or some columns only?
CHECK- can we exclude long and lob

    ggsci> DBLogin UserIDAlias oggusersl
    ggsci> Add TranData OGGSOL.TABLE1  ALLCOLS   (or, OGGSOL.* for all tables)
    ggsci> Info TranData OGGSOL.*
    Logging of supplemental redo log data is enabled for table OGGSOL.TABLE1.
    Columns supplementally logged for table OGGSOL.TABLE1: ALL.
    
» Source Standby - Create an Extract parameter file on source Unix system.
This will create a file dirprm/ea1.prm for the extract process.
NOTE: Added tranlogoption ARCHIVELOGONLY to direct extract process to mine from archived logs
NOTE: Removed SETENV (ORACLE_SID='SOURCE_ORACLE_SID') which was in the Oracle integrated tutorial. 
        Instead, use useridalias which is based on connect string.
NOTE: Naming e for extract, l for ALO, 1 is a serial number
NOTE: Trail name e for extract, l for ALO
NOTE: (DBLOGREADER is not supported in ALO) DBLOGREADER API is available with better performance in 11.2+,  use DBLOGREADERBUFSIZE instead of ASMBUFSIZE.
NOTE: Add DDL LATER - it is slightly different from regular classic mode in ADG

Modified: Removed DDL, removed DBLOGREADER, added ASMUSER, NOTE: sys@ASM has ASM which is the tns alias added earlier

    NOTE - In this, if you get an error "enable_goldengate_replication is not set to true" 
             then set the following:   alter system set ENABLE_GOLDENGATE_REPLICATION=true scope=both;
    NOTE - 'begin now' can be replaced with 'begin scn <scn number>'
    NOTE: Megabytes 10 is optional - default is 100

>> Source Standby - Configure data-pump

    NOTE: The remote_hostname is the destination host, or localhost (or local host's hostname) 
            if both source and dest are same host
    CHECK: What about RAC - how do we give SID and HOST in the case of RAC - how to handle failover to other nodes??
    
    NOTE:  The data pump reads from the local trail file in and writes to the remote trail file pn. 
            The remote trail file that will be created will be named dirdat/pn000000, then when that one 
            fills up the next will be dirdat/pn000001, then dirdat/pn000002, and so on.

    In this step, the secondary Extract will be created and configured, but not started. 
    NOTE: Replace 'remote_hostname' below with the remote hostname or localhost if local
    NOTE: Removed SETENV ORACLE_SID as dbuseralias has the connect string
    NOTE: Need to change remote_hostname when instance/site switchover happens

>> Dest Primary - Configure Repcat process
NOTE: Removed SETENV(ORACLE_SID='DEST_ORACLE_SID') as useridalias has tns alias
NOTE: Removed DBOPTIONS INTEGRATEDPARAMS(parallelism 6) as classic does not support parallel
NOTE: Exttrail here is 'pc' which is pump file and not 'ec' which is extract process' trail
NOTE: Added checkpoint table that is needed for classic extract
NOTE: Removed 'integrated' directive in 'add replicat'
NOTE:::  we can still use integrated repcat though extract is classic

===== NEED TO START HERE ====

All processes seemed to start and run well.
Inserted some rows to table1 at primary.
Did archive-log-current on source-primary.
Queried the table in open-read-only source-standby - which showed the rows.

However, destination did not show the rows.
Also, GG-logs in source-standby did not show they saw the rows.

  4.1.3 Other Oracle GoldenGate Users
  A user is required in the source database for the Manager process if you are using Oracle GoldenGate DDL support. This user performs maintenance on the Oracle GoldenGate database objects that support DDL capture.
  A user is required in either the source or target database for the DEFGEN utility. The location depends on where the data definition file is being generated. This user performs local metadata queries to build a data-definitions file that supplies the metadata to remote Oracle GoldenGate instances. For more information about the data-definitions file, see Administering Oracle GoldenGate for Windows and UNIX.
  Additional users or privileges may be required to use the following features, if Extract will run in classic capture mode:
  •RMAN log retention (see Section 11.4.2, "Log Retention Options")
  •TDE support (see Chapter 11, "Configuring Oracle TDE Data in Classic Capture Mode")
  •ASM (see Chapter 11, "Mining ASM-stored Logs in Classic Capture Mode")
