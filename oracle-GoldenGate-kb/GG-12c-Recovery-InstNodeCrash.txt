GOLDENGATE - DB INSTANCE/NODE CRASH RECOVERY

INSTANCE/DB STOPPING
====================
DBUserAlias uses TNS entry which uses scan - so, ideally, GG should be instance agnostic
Instance stops - one of multiple instances
GG mgr keeps running
GG processes (extract, repcat) abend - pump continues to run
Instance restarts
GG mgr retries to start those processes
After some time processes restart and connect well 
-Depends upon mgr parameters 
- AUTORESTART Extract *, WaitMinutes 1, Retries 10
- AUTORESTART Replicat *, WaitMinutes 1, Retries 10
- For Pump, there is no auto-restart - it does not actually stop upon inst/db stop
- CHECK- For pump, we need to place a monitor/restart script in the case it crashes
NOTE: This behavior of re-connection is similar with instance and DB stop and restart
NOTE: Stop/abend of extract/replicat happen because they are connected to any one instance at a time
