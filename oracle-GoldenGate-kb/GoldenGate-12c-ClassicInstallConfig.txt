  Issue the ADD TRANDATA command.
  ADD TRANDATA [container.]schema.table [, COLS (columns)] [, NOKEY] [, ALLCOLS | NOSCHEDULINGCOLS]

CONFIGURATION

>> Source - Enable goldengate replication in the database
SQL> alter system set ENABLE_GOLDENGATE_REPLICATION=true scope=both;

>> Source - Add supplemental logging
  This sets a 'minimum db level supplemental logging' at DB level.  
  Additional TRANDATA, SCHEMATRANDATA etc is set at GG level.
  SQL> ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;
  SQL> SELECT supplemental_log_data_min, force_logging FROM v$database;
  SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;

>> Source - Create GG user
  create tablespace goldengate datafile '+DATA_DG01'; -- GG user in source needs its own tablespace for handling DDLs
  -- GG user should have its own tablespace in destination to support marker, ddl etc

  default tablespace goldengate temporary tablespace temp;

  grant create session to oggusersc;

  --grant execute on sys.dbms_internal_clkm -- for TDE
  grant select any transaction to oggusersc;
  grant select any dictionary to oggusersc;
  grant select any table to oggusersc; --> this was necessary for extract/pump to know the table via dictionary

» Source - Add supplemental log data for update operations.

>> Source - Configure mgr process
NOTE: Trailfiles can have only two-letter prefix.  So, e1 for extract1 is used here (or 'in' as in Orcle integrated tutorial)
NOTE: This 'modification' is not necessary - actually it can hamper work of multiple ext processes on same server - Tutorial said ./dirdat/* --> now modified to match with exttrail 'in'
CHECK- What should be purgeoldextracts policy - * or something else
CHECK- Minkeephours or minimum logs to keep
CHECK- Autostart extract or not
CHECK- Autostart only some extracts or all

>> Source - Setup TRANDATA (new in 12c)
This is further to setting up supplemental logging. Before you can start capturing real-time data, 
the Oracle database must be set to log the table key values whenever it logs a rows change, 
so that they are available to Oracle GoldenGate in Redo. By default, the database logs only those column 
values that change. This is required so Oracle GoldenGate can locate the correct row on the target 
for update and delete operations.
NOTE:  This can be done for all tables, specific tables, all columns, specific columns
CHECK- should we do it for ALLCOLS or some columns only?
CHECK- can we exclude long and lob

    ggsci> DBLogin UserIDAlias oggusersc
    ggsci> Add TranData OGGSOC.TABLE1  ALLCOLS   (or, OGGSOC.* for all tables)
    ggsci> Info TranData OGGSOC.*
    Columns supplementally logged for table OGGSRCOWNER.TABLE1: ALL.
    
» Source - Create an Extract parameter file on source Unix system.

This will create a file dirprm/eprojecta.prm for the extract process.
NOTE: Removed SETENV (ORACLE_SID='SOURCE_ORACLE_SID') which was in the tutorial. 
      Instead, useridalias has connect string.
NOTE: Naming e for extract, c for classic, 1 is a serial number
NOTE: Trail name e for extract, c for classic
NOTE: DBLOGREADER API is available with better performance in 11.2+,  
      use DBLOGREADERBUFSIZE instead of ASMBUFSIZE.
      
NOTE: Added DDL also - however, that ABENDED --> needs prep steps - see below: 
--> To set up DDL replication, do steps in DDL REPLICATION section towards the end of this document
Otherwise the following types of errors will show up:

    CHECK: What about RAC - how do we give SID and HOST in the case of RAC - how to handle failover to other nodes??
    
    NOTE:  The data pump reads from the local trail file in and writes to the remote trail file pn. 
            The remote trail file that will be created will be named dirdat/pn000000, then when that one 
            fills up the next will be dirdat/pn000001, then dirdat/pn000002, and so on.

    In this step, the secondary Extract will be created and configured, but not started. 
    NOTE: Replace 'remote_hostname' below with the remote hostname or localhost if local
    NOTE: Removed SETENV ORACLE_SID as dbuseralias has the connect string

  4.1.3 Other Oracle GoldenGate Users
  A user is required in the source database for the Manager process if you are using Oracle GoldenGate DDL support. This user performs maintenance on the Oracle GoldenGate database objects that support DDL capture.
  A user is required in either the source or target database for the DEFGEN utility. The location depends on where the data definition file is being generated. This user performs local metadata queries to build a data-definitions file that supplies the metadata to remote Oracle GoldenGate instances. For more information about the data-definitions file, see Administering Oracle GoldenGate for Windows and UNIX.
  Additional users or privileges may be required to use the following features, if Extract will run in classic capture mode:
  •RMAN log retention (see Section 11.4.2, "Log Retention Options")
  •TDE support (see Chapter 11, "Configuring Oracle TDE Data in Classic Capture Mode")
  •ASM (see Chapter 11, "Mining ASM-stored Logs in Classic Capture Mode")
