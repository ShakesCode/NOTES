Hi,
 
 As database archivelog was reset, the extract process was abended. When I start the extract, it was looking for 1480 archive log and it was not available.  Please let me know how to restart the extract by resetting the next log sequence no.. i.e 1. 
Thank you for your help

 1. take a copy of extract checkpoint file (EXT_DDRQ.cpe) in ogg home/dirchk

2. ggsci> alter EXT_DDRQ, extseqno 1, extrba 0
ggsci> start EXT_DDRQ

Thanks,
Raj

Here are the steps after resetlogs:
1. stop the goldengate components
2. Open the database with restlogs option
3. Do 1-2 archivelog change that let there be new archive logs after the resetlogs
4. The goldengate extract will look for that file after startup where it was when you stopped. This will the last applied archivelog file. You can query it with:

ggsci> info <extract>

in the output you will see like :

EXTRACT <extract> Last Started 2011-03-08 14:58 Status STOPPED
Checkpoint Lag 00:00:00 (updated 02:28:37 ago)
Log Read Checkpoint Oracle Redo Logs
2011-03-08 14:35:28 Seqno 112, RBA 9451234


Here the extract will look for the sequence 112 and rba 9451234 (I will use it in this example).

4.1. If you see that the archivelog file with sequence 112 is the same size on the OS as the RBA what the goldengate shows above, and there is no other archive logfile
with higher sequence number but only the new archivelogs which starts from 1 after the resetlogs then you can stop the extract and change the sequence number to 1, like:

ggsci> alter <extract> extseqno 1 extrba 0

to start the extract from 1. new archivelog.


4.2. Though if you see that the archivelog file what you see above is bigger than the RBA in the recovery checkpoint, or there are archivelog file with higher sequence value, than
it means that you stopped the extract before it could read all the archive logs. In this case you have to achieve that the extract still reads all the records from the before resetlogs archived logfiles.

Add this line to the extract parameter file:

TRANLOGOPTIONS ARCHIVEDLOGONLY, ALTARCHIVELOGDEST PRIMARY <path where the archived logs files are>

and start the extract to read data from the old archived logs.

4.3 If the extract fails, that the archived log files, it is looking for do not exist, check whether the archived logs are there.

It is possible that the extract will look for a different name file. Like, you have got this file:

/u02/oracle/archlog2/1_112_745252447.dbf

but the extract is looking for:

/u02/oracle/archlog2/1_112_788888888.dbf

I.e. in the report file you will see errors like:

2011-03-08 14:54:02 ERROR OGG-00446 Could not find archived log for sequence 112 thread 1 under alternative destinations. SQL
<Not available>. Last alternative log tried /u02/oracle/archlog2/1_112_788888888.dbf failed to open redo file /u02/oracle/archlog2
/1_112_788888888.dbf for sequence 112 during initial positioningNot able to establish initial position for sequence 112, rba 77328
.

Here the difference is the last number, which means that the extract construncted the name of the archivelog file from the sequence number and the resetlog value of the current rdbms.

In this case you should create a symbolic link for the archived log files what extract needs to the existing archive log file.

So for example if you have got 3 archived log files, which still not processed by the extract:

/u02/oracle/archlog2/1_112_745252447.dbf
/u02/oracle/archlog2/1_113_745252447.dbf
/u02/oracle/archlog2/1_114_745252447.dbf

but the extract is failing on opening file:
/u02/oracle/archlog2/1_112_788888888.dbf

then create a link on all the files with the new name like:

ln -s 1_112_745252447.dbf 1_112_788888888.dbf
ln -s 1_113_745252447.dbf 1_113_788888888.dbf
ln -s 1_114_745252447.dbf 1_114_788888888.dbf

4.4 then restart the extract. Now it will pickup the archived log files and progress till sequence number 114. When you see in the extract information:

ggsci> info <extract>

EXTRACT <extract> Last Started 2011-03-08 14:58 Status STOPPED
Checkpoint Lag 00:00:00 (updated 02:28:37 ago)
Log Read Checkpoint Oracle Redo Logs
2011-03-08 14:35:28 Seqno 114, RBA 9451234

that the extract is standing on the last available archived log files from the before resetlogs time, and the RBA - in the above case : 9451234 - is the size of the last
redo log file, then you can stop the extract as it has reached the end of the logfile.

4.5 Now you can reposition the extract to the first new archived log file:

ggsci> alter <extract> extseqno 1 extrba 0

4.6 Remove the line you have added in point 4.2:
TRANLOGOPTIONS ARCHIVEDLOGONLY, ALTARCHIVELOGDEST PRIMARY <path where the archived logs files are>

4.7 and restart the extract to start to read from the first new archived log file after the resetlogs. 

Please mark the answers above as Correct / helpful if any of them helped you.

 Also this is a limitation with only classic extract. The integrated extract/ capture supports db resetlogs without
manual intervention

Thanks,
Raj
