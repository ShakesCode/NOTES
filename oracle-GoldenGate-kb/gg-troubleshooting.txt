TROUBLESHOOTING
=============================
USEFUL COMMANDS AND TRICKS
=============================
VIEW EXTENDED ERROR AND CONFIG REPORT
ggsci> view report ec1
This gives much configuration and hardware o/s setup info 
AND gives extended error message at end like the following:

The message below was not in ggserr.log
  2015-08-25 19:17:15  ERROR   OGG-00664  OCI Error beginning session 
  (status = 257-ORA-00257: archiver error. Connect internal only, until freed.)
  2015-08-25 19:17:15  ERROR   OGG-01668  PROCESS ABENDING.


=============================
TROUBLESHOOTING
=============================
ORA-1950 - INSUFFICIENT PERMISSIONS ON SYSAUX TABLESPACE
>>Reason- Logminer objects are owned by SYSTEM mostly, and some are by SYS
Those objects are in SYSAUX.  By default SYSTEM may not have sufficient quota/unlimited tablespace on SYSAUX.
>>Fix- GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO SYSTEM;

GG DOES NOT START/STOP
>>Reason1- software or directory (dirprm etc if centrally located) may be 100% full
Clear some useless files to make space

>>Reason2 - DB may be halted due to archiver error
Clear some archivelogs or back them up to tape or make space in FRA/archlog-destination

LAG WHILE NO REAL LAG
GG may show last-record-lag due to stray long-running transactions

CORRELATE DATABASE TRANSACTION WITH GOLDENGATE LAG
======================================================

Sometimes, GG seems to show a lag, while it is actually still moving ahead.
This could be because of a long running transaction.
To find the transaction in the DB:

>Find the XID (also gives additional info on oldest redolog necessary to restart transaction)
ggsci> send eigowa, showtrans duration 10m  (DURATION is optional)

Sending showtrans request to EXTRACT ESAN ...
Oldest redo log file necessary to restart Extract is:
Redo Log Sequence Number 196, RBA 4955152
------------------------------------------------------------
XID:                  3.29.673
Items:                1
Extract:              ESAN

Status:               Running

>Now, run the folowing SQL

-- trans.sql
set lines 200 pages 1000
col xid for a16
col username for a18
col schemaname for a18
col osuser for a12
select t.start_time, t.xidusn||'.'||t.xidslot||'.'||t.xidsqn xid, s.status,
s.sid,s.serial#,s.username,s.status,s.schemaname,
decode(s.sql_id,null,s.prev_sql_id) sqlid, decode(s.sql_child_number,null,s.prev_child_number) child
from v$transaction t, v$session s
where s.saddr = t.ses_addr
order by t.start_time
;
