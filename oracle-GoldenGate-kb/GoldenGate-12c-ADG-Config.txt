GOLDEN GATE CONFIGURATION WITH ACTIVE-DATA-GUARD (ADG) AS SOURCE

<< In progress now >>

CONFIGURATION
SRC-ADG-D20E-PRIM-ON-4, D20C-STBY-ON-5
DEST-REGULAR-PRIM-STBY-D21E-PRIM-ON-4, NO STBY AS OF NOW

KEY THINGS
https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/1212/gg-winux/GIORA/classic_capture.htm#GIORA998
You must connect to the primary database from GGSCI to add TRANDATA or SCHEMATRANDATA because this is done on the primary database.

DDL triggers cannot be used on the standby database, in order to support DDL replication (except ADDTRANDATA). You must install the Oracle GoldenGate DDL package on the primary database.

DDL ADDTRANDATA is not supported in ADG mode; you must use ADDSCHEMATRANDATA for DDL replication.

When adding extract on the standby database, you must specify the starting position using a specific SCN value, timestamp, or log position. Relative timestamp values, such as NOW, become ambiguous and may lead to data inconsistency.

When adding extract on the standby database, you must specify the number of threads that will include all of the relevant threads from the primary database.

During or after failover or switchover, no thread can be added or dropped from either primary or standby databases.

Classic Extract will only use one intervening RESETLOG operation.

If you do not want to relocate your Oracle GoldenGate installation, then you must position it in a shared space where the Oracle GoldenGate installation directory can be accessed from both the primary and standby databases.

If you are moving capture off of an ADG standby database to a primary database, then you must point your net alias to the primary database and you must remove the TRANLOG options.

Classic Extract cannot use the DBLOGREADER option. Use ASMUSER (there is approximately a 20gb/hr read limit) or move the online and archive logs outside of the Application Security Manager on both the primary and the standby databases.

GENERAL

  Capture from Active Data Guard (ADG) Standby with Classic Extract - The new TRANLOGOPTIONS MINEFROMACTIVEDG 
  option allows classic extracts to mine online redo logs shipped to the Oracle Active Data Guard standby system. 
  Oracle GoldenGate connects to the standby database to get metadata and other required data as needed.

CONFIGURATION

>> Source Primary - Enable goldengate replication in the database
SQL> alter system set ENABLE_GOLDENGATE_REPLICATION=true scope=both;

>> Source Primary - Add supplemental logging
  This sets a 'minimum db level supplemental logging' at DB level.  
  Additional TRANDATA, SCHEMATRANDATA etc is set at GG level.
  SQL> ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;
  SQL> SELECT supplemental_log_data_min, force_logging FROM v$database;
  SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;

>> Source Primary - Create GG user
  create tablespace goldengate datafile '+DATA_DG01'; -- GG user in source needs its own tablespace for handling DDLs
  -- GG user should have its own tablespace in destination to support marker, ddl etc
  create user oggusersc identified by oggusersc

  --grant execute on sys.dbms_internal_clkm -- for TDE
  grant select any transaction to oggusersa;
  grant select any dictionary to oggusersq;
  grant select any table to oggusersq; --> this was necessary for extract/pump to know the table via dictionary

   empname varchar2(20));
  
  grant flashback on oggsoa.table1 to oggusersa;
  grant select on oggsoa.table1 to oggusersa;

>> Source Standby - Configure mgr process
NOTE: Trailfiles can have only two-letter prefix.  So, e1 for extract1 is used here (or 'in' as in Orcle integrated tutorial)
NOTE: This 'modification' is not necessary - actually it can hamper work of multiple ext processes on same server - Tutorial said ./dirdat/* --> now modified to match with exttrail 'in'
CHECK- What should be purgeoldextracts policy - * or something else
CHECK- Minkeephours or minimum logs to keep
CHECK- Autostart extract or not
CHECK- Autostart only some extracts or all

    $ ggsci
    ggsci> edit param mgr
      PORT 7809
      DynamicPortList 20000-20099

      << save with :wq if editor was vi >>
    ggsci> stop mgr
    ggsci> start mgr
    
>> Source Primary - Setup TRANDATA (new in 12c)
This is further to setting up supplemental logging. Before you can start capturing real-time data, 
the Oracle database must be set to log the table key values whenever it logs a rows change, 
so that they are available to Oracle GoldenGate in Redo. By default, the database logs only those column 
values that change. This is required so Oracle GoldenGate can locate the correct row on the target 
for update and delete operations.
NOTE:  This can be done for all tables, specific tables, all columns, specific columns
CHECK- should we do it for ALLCOLS or some columns only?
CHECK- can we exclude long and lob

    ggsci> DBLogin UserIDAlias oggusersa
    ggsci> Add TranData OGGSOA.TABLE1  ALLCOLS   (or, OGGSOA.* for all tables)
    ggsci> Info TranData OGGSOA.*
    Logging of supplemental redo log data is enabled for table OGGSOA.TABLE1.
    Columns supplementally logged for table OGGSOA.TABLE1: ALL.
    
>> Source Standby - Add ASM tns entry
ASM=
   (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = host-vip1) (PORT = 1521))
       (CONNECT_DATA =
              (SID=+ASM1)
       )
   )


» Source Standby - Create an Extract parameter file on source Unix system.
This will create a file dirprm/ea1.prm for the extract process.
NOTE: Added tranlogoption MINEFROMACTIVEDG to direct extract process to mine from standby side
NOTE: Removed SETENV (ORACLE_SID='SOURCE_ORACLE_SID') which was in the tutorial. Instead, useridalias has connect string.
NOTE: Naming e for extract, a for ADG, 1 is a serial number
NOTE: Trail name e for extract, a for ADG
NOTE: (DBLOGREADER is not supported in ADG) DBLOGREADER API is available with better performance in 11.2+,  use DBLOGREADERBUFSIZE instead of ASMBUFSIZE.
NOTE: Add DDL LATER - it is slightly different from regular classic mode in ADG

Modified: Removed DDL, removed DBLOGREADER, added ASMUSER, NOTE: sys@ASM has ASM which is the tns alias added earlier

logs outside of the Application Security Manager on both the primary and the standby databases.

NOTE: skipped the 'register step' and directly did begin now and start - it seemed to start well
======
» Source Standby - Register Extract in database
    This will register the extract, but not start extract yet

    NOTE - In this, if you get an error "enable_goldengate_replication is not set to true" 
             then set the following:   alter system set ENABLE_GOLDENGATE_REPLICATION=true scope=both;
    NOTE - 'begin now' can be replaced with 'begin scn <scn number>'
    NOTE: Megabytes 10 is optional - default is 100

    ggsci> dblogin useridalias oggusersa
    ggsci> register extract ea1 database
    ERROR: Cannot register or unregister EXTRACT EA1 because of the following SQL error: OCI Error 1,109.
    instead of success:
    Extract EA1 successfully registered with database at SCN 1328963.

    ggsci> add extract ea1, tranlog, threads 2, begin now 
    

    ggsci> add exttrail ./dirdat/ea, extract ea1, megabytes 10
    EXTTRAIL added.
    
    ggsci> start extract ea1

    Sending START request to MANAGER ...
    EXTRACT EA1 starting
    
    NOTE: The info below is different from what you see in 'integrated' extract process' info
    ggsci> info ea1
    
>> Source Standby - Configure data-pump

    NOTE: The remote_hostname is the destination host, or localhost (or local host's hostname) 
            if both source and dest are same host
    CHECK: What about RAC - how do we give SID and HOST in the case of RAC - how to handle failover to other nodes??
    
    NOTE:  The data pump reads from the local trail file in and writes to the remote trail file pn. 
            The remote trail file that will be created will be named dirdat/pn000000, then when that one 
            fills up the next will be dirdat/pn000001, then dirdat/pn000002, and so on.

    In this step, the secondary Extract will be created and configured, but not started. 
    NOTE: Replace 'remote_hostname' below with the remote hostname or localhost if local
    NOTE: Removed SETENV ORACLE_SID as dbuseralias has the connect string
    NOTE: Need to change remote_hostname when instance/site switchover happens

>> OTHER USERS REQUIRED  < not fully understood/done >
  https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/1212/gg-winux/GIORA/user_assignment.htm#GIORA551
  4.1.3 Other Oracle GoldenGate Users
  A user is required in the source database for the Manager process if you are using Oracle GoldenGate DDL support. This user performs maintenance on the Oracle GoldenGate database objects that support DDL capture.
  A user is required in either the source or target database for the DEFGEN utility. The location depends on where the data definition file is being generated. This user performs local metadata queries to build a data-definitions file that supplies the metadata to remote Oracle GoldenGate instances. For more information about the data-definitions file, see Administering Oracle GoldenGate for Windows and UNIX.
  Additional users or privileges may be required to use the following features, if Extract will run in classic capture mode:
  •RMAN log retention (see Section 11.4.2, "Log Retention Options")
  •TDE support (see Chapter 11, "Configuring Oracle TDE Data in Classic Capture Mode")
  •ASM (see Chapter 11, "Mining ASM-stored Logs in Classic Capture Mode")
