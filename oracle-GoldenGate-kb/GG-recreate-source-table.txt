Section 
20.4.5 Dropping and Recreating a Source Table
Dropping and recreating a source table requires caution when performed while Oracle GoldenGate is running.

Stop access to the table.

Allow Extract to process any remaining changes to that table from the transaction logs. To determine when Extract is finished, use the INFO EXTRACT command in GGSCI.

INFO EXTRACT group
Stop Extract.

STOP EXTRACT group
Drop and recreate the table.

If supported for this database, run the ADD TRANDATA command in GGSCI for the table.

If the recreate action changed the source table's definitions so that they are different from those of the target, run the DEFGEN utility for the source table to generate source definitions, and then replace the old definitions with the new definitions in the existing source definitions file on the target system.

Permit user access to the table.
