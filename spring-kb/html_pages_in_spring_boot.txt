Add a Home Page

Static resources, like HTML or JavaScript or CSS, can easily be served from your Spring Boot application 
just be dropping them into the right place in the source code. 
By default Spring Boot serves static content from resources in the classpath at "/static" (or "/public"). 
The index.html resource is special because it is used as a "welcome page" if it exists, which means it will be served up as the root resource, i.e. at http://localhost:8080/ in our example. So create this file:

src/main/resources/static/index.html

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <p>Get your greeting <a href="/greeting">here</a></p>
</body>
</html>
