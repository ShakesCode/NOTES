NOTE: The doc talks about catalog DB which is non-CDB. Here, I have used a CDB-PDB for the catalog

------------------
CREATE THE CATALOG
------------------
Create a Container database with PDB DB12C2PD1
Create a tablespace rman at pdb level
Create a user rman password rman (or other) at pdb level
Create a tns entry for the PDB
DB12C2PD1=
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = rac01-scan)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = DB12C2PD1)
    )
  )

Connect to this 'rman' schema using RMAN as follows:
$ rman target /
RMAN> connect catalog rman/rman@DB12C2PD1

Create the catalog:
- to create in default tablespace of the 'rman' user:
RMAN> CREATE CATALOG;
recovery catalog created

- to create in another tablespace ts1
NOTE: If the name of the tablespace itself is a reserved word, then make it uppercase and enclose in quotes like tablespace 'PROFILE'
RMAN> CREATE CATALOG TABLESPACE ts1;
recovery catalog created

Register a database
