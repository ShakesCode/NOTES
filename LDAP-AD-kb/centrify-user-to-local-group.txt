This becomes essential in cases where explicit membership to a local group is necessary.
Example - a Unix user (ldap user also) MUST belong to a LOCAL GROUP 
          - though they may belong to the same named AD/Centrify group.

Step 1. In order to add the AD User to the local User Group

adduser command is not nsswitch aware and do not recognize a user not locally defined when adding someone to a group.

# vim /etc/group
.....
.....
users:x:100:user1,user2
Step 2: Edit /etc/centrifydc/centrifydc.conf
Edit /etc/centrifydc/centrifydc.conf, uncomment and change the following parameter to true

# Merge local group membership from /etc/group into the Centrify group
# response for groups with the same name and gid.  This violates the NSS
# interface behavior and may have unexpected side effects, so it is
# disabled by default. You must run adreload to detect changes
# in the local group file.
#
adclient.local.group.merge:true
Step 3: Centrify Load and Flush

# adreload && adflush
Step 4: Check and verify.

Logon as user1

$ id -a
uid=.........gid=.......... 100(users) .....................
