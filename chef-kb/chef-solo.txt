solo.rb configuration:
https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_solo.html

Chef-Solo can be used for testing cookbooks locally before finalizing and uploading to chef server.
Its advantage is that it does not contact chef server and pull cookbooks from there 
  - so no need to increase version and upload to chef-server etc.
  
======================
SETUP AND RUN
======================

------------------
SETUP 
------------------
As'root' or root-sudoable user

- Create a directory /var/chef/solo-testing (or other)
- Create a subdirectory 'cookbooks' under it
- Create or download a cookbook, say, oracle-client-install, under that cookbooks folder

- Create a configuration file solo.rb under /var/chef/solo-testing (or other directory used).
With content as follows:

cookbook_path ['/var/chef/solo-testing/cookbooks']
log_level :info

- Create a json file defining the run-list: (under /var/chef/solo-testing or elsewhere)
{
"run_list": [
  "recipe[oracle12c-client-rhel::default]",
  "recipe[tomcat-install::default]"
]
}

-------------------
RUN
-------------------
As 'root' or root-sudoable user
From /var/chef/solo-testing (or other directory used)

- Call a run list as follows
# chef-solo -c ./solo.rb -j ./oracleclient.json

- Call a specific recipe as follows
# chef-solo -c ./solo.rb  -o  oracle12c-client-install::os_prerequisites

This shows screen messages as chef-client would log to STDOUT or logfile.
And, it will do the actual work to be done by the cookbook (not just a dummy message-only run)
