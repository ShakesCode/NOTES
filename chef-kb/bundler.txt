bundle show
bundle install --> installs gems specified by Gemfile or Gemfile.lock
bundle update
bundle package(1) bundle-package.1.html
  Package  the  .gem  files  required by your application into the
  vendor/cache directory
bundle exec --> Execute a script in the context of the current bundle (like 'bundle exec kitchen...')

bundle exec kitchen help
  (from https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/wiki/Getting-Started)
  To verify Test Kitchen is installed, run the kitchen help command:

  $ bundle exec kitchen help
  You should see something like:
  
  Commands:
    kitchen console                          # Kitchen Console!
    kitchen converge [(all|<REGEX>)] [opts]  # Converge one or more instances
    kitchen create [(all|<REGEX>)] [opts]    # Create one or more instances
    kitchen destroy [(all|<REGEX>)] [opts]   # Destroy one or more instances
    kitchen driver                           # Driver subcommands
    kitchen driver create [NAME]             # Create a new Kitchen Driver gem project
    kitchen driver discover                  # Discover Test Kitchen drivers published on RubyGems
    kitchen driver help [COMMAND]            # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
    kitchen help [COMMAND]                   # Describe available commands or one specific command
    kitchen init                             # Adds some configuration to your cookbook so Kitchen can rock
    kitchen list [(all|<REGEX>)]             # List all instances
    
  Instead, got this:
    Could not find addressable-2.3.8 in any of the sources
    Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
