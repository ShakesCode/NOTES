Chef Lab – Cookbook Basics
Environment
Laptop/Desktop installed environment with berkshelf, vagrant, knife, chef-solo, git-bash.
Using Knife to create cookbooks
(We can use berks cookbook command also, but tried knife here)

http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/first-steps-with-chef.html
This site  has a good one with multiple recipes combination etc.
However, using the basics there, this section does a limited test lab of simple functions

Specify location of cookbooks to Knife:
Do a ‘cd’ to go to home directory
Create a folder .chef
Create a file knife.rb in .chef
Enter the cookbook folder path in it –
Cookbook_path [‘/Users/myusername/cookbooks’]

Note:  do not add /c/ before Users – then it will create a directory ‘c’ under C:
Note:  If knife.rb is not present, it will create them under C:/chef/cookbooks by default

Create the cookbook using knife:  (idea from http://reiddraper.com/first-chef-recipe/)
knife cookbook create create_dir
	Cd to cookbooks/create_dir/recipes

	Edit default.rb so that it can create a directory c:/c/create_dir1 (note two ‘c’) - 
		directory “/c/create_dir1”


Create a file solo.rb to configure chef-solo folders:
	Do a ‘cd’ to home directory
	Edit solo.rb with the following –
File_cache_path “/Users/myusername/chef-solo"
Cookbook_path “/Users/myusername/cookbooks”

Create the json file to run the recipes:
	Do a ‘cd’ to home directory
	Edit create_dir.json with the following –
{
    “run_list”: [“recipe[create_dir]”]
}

Run the json file:
        chef-solo –c solo.rb –j create_dir.json

NOTE :  Error stack trace are dumped into ~/chef-solo/ folder (that is /Users/username/chef-solo)

Verify:
Verify if C:/c/create_dir1 got created  (success)

Add one more recipe and run both together:  (idea from http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/first-steps-with-chef.html for multi-recipe,  for directories and attributes  http://reiddraper.com/first-chef-recipe/)

Create another cookbook to create a new directory and touch a file in it:
In ~/cookbooks, run “knife cookbook create create_dir2”

Set up an attribute for a new directory and a file in that directory:
Go to ‘attributes’ directory under cookbooks/create_dir2 and create a default.rb 
Edit default.rb with the following content –
(syntax default[:cookbookname][:attributename] = “attributevalue”)
default[:create_dir2][:dir] = “/c/create_dir2_dir”
default[:create_dir2][:touchfilename] = “touchfile.txt”

Create the recipe:
In ~/cookbooks/recipes edit default.rb as follows –
directory node[:create_dir2][:dir]
file “#{node[:create_dir2][:dir]}/#node{node[:create_dir2][:touchfile]}”
# NOTE the hash and curly brackets which are required to form a new string from various attributes
#file node[:create_dir2][:touchfile] à however, this created the file in C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore and not in create_dir2_dir


Edit ~/create_dir.json adding this new recipe along with the old one –
{
“run_list”: [“recipe[create_dir]”,  “recipe[create_dir2]”]
}

Remove the directory C:/c/create_dir1 created earlier so that the new run re-creates it

Run the create_dir.json again

Download a file using a cookbook

https://docs.chef.io/resource_remote_file.html
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/04/curl-examples/
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/07/wget-curl/

Curl did not seem to work well – should try again.
è	It worked on command line in the VM with the following command
è	curl --proxy-user username:password http://download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip
o	Username, password were important as proxy server was not letting download without them
Found ‘source’ directive and ‘remote_file’ directive and used it.
è	Local on laptop errored as it needs admin privileges
è	Instead, added that as an additional recipe in Vagrantfile and did a ‘vagrant provision’ which was successful (see details below)
Local on the laptop:

NOTE: This errored out expecting admin privileges on the laptop to actually populate a file.  It creates/touches empty files, but does not download/echo into the file.

Cd ~/cookbooks
Run ‘knife cookbook create download_a_file’
Edit recipes/default.rb with the following commands:
remote_file "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/large-file.tar.gz" do
  source "http://www.example.org/large-file.tar.gz"
end
#curl https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/attorney/Convenience_Brief/instructions/Create_Enhanced_Brief.pdf

Create the json file to run the recipes:
	Do a ‘cd’ to home directory
	Edit create_dir.json with the following –
{
    “run_list”: [“recipe[create_dir]”]
}

Run the json file:
        chef-solo –c solo.rb –j create_dir.json

Vagrant Provision:

In recipes folder create download_file.rb with the following content:
remote_file  ” /tmp/master.zip ” do
source “some file in internet”
end

Add this recipe to chef.run_list in Vagrantfile
Do ‘vagrant provision’
Logon to the VM and verify if the file got downloaded à success (when proxy was not there at home), failed requiring proxy authentication when done in office
o	Setting proxy credentials in client.rb somehow did not help
