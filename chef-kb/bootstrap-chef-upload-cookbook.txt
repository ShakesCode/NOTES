=================================================
        BOOTSTRAPPING TO CHEF SERVER
=================================================

NOTE - SEE ALSO Chef-Notes-Advanced.txt

Three files are needed:
knife.rb
<organization>-validator.pem
<chef server username>.pem

-------------------
CHEF SERVER ACCOUNT
-------------------
Create an account in your chef-server, with the email address to use
Public hosted chef - https://getchef.opscode.com

-----------------
ORGANIZATION
-----------------
Create an organization - say, g (comp) or gdba (pub)

Click on 'administration' tab - it will list the organizations
Click on the required organization from the list

==========================
VALIDATOR AND KNIFE FILES
==========================

HINT- DO THIS ONCE AND SAVE ALL FILES IN A SAFE PLACE
CAUTION - in particular, the organization pem file better be not lost

------------------------------
DOWNLOADING USING STARTER-KIT
------------------------------
Go to the specific organization
Click on the left hand pane 'starter kit'
It will warn - "Your user and organization keys will be reset. Are you sure you want to do this?"
--> BOTH user and organization keys will be reset
Download the chef-starter.zip
It contains a folder structure as follows in it:
chef-repo/ --> .chef/ --> <userid>.pem, <organization>-validator.pem, knife.rb
chef-repo/ --> cookbooks/
chef-repo/ --> roles/
chef-repo/ --> .gitignore
chef-repo/ --> README.md

> WHERE TO COPY THEM TO:
If using unix or windows, this can be extracted as is - OR - only contents under chef-repo can be placed in working folder
--> THAT IS, into the folder that contains cookbook
Example:
Note that both .chef and cookbooks be in the same folder
chef-repo/.chef
chef-repo/cookbooks

In Bill's Kitchen - it could be .chef under O:/home if creating cookbooks folder or O:/ itself to keep cookbooks under O:/

NOTE: In knife.rb, you can change cookbook folder path to be absolute path of choice than its default relative path

-------------------------
DOWNLOADING ONE AT A TIME
-------------------------
NOTE: Download one by one, and use the layout as described under starter-kit method

NOTE: The steps below show how to generate the three files separately.
        An alternative is to download 'starter kit' which contains .chef folder and the three files under it zipped in a file
        --> HOWEVER, this will reset the validator key.  
        --> If you DO NOT want to reset it, then you can generate only the needed files and use the old working validator file
--------
KNIFE.RB
--------
Click on the 'Generate Knife Config' on the left hand side panel
--> Save the generated file into a safe location

Contents of the file:
  # See https://docs.getchef.com/config_rb_knife.html for more information on knife configuration options
  
  current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
  log_level                :info
  log_location             STDOUT
  node_name                "<userid>"
  client_key               "#{current_dir}/<userid>.pem"
  validation_client_name   "<organization>-validator"
  validation_key           "#{current_dir}/<organization>-validator.pem"
  chef_server_url          "https://chef-server.company.com/organizations/<organization>"
  cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]

----------------------------
<ORGANIZATOIN>-VALIDATOR.PEM
----------------------------
Click on the 'Reset Validator Key' 
(CAUTION - IF YOU HAVE USED A DIFFERENT VALIDATOR KEY BEFORE, THIS RESET WILL STOP THOSE SETUPS FROM WORKING ANYMORE)
  It will display a caution - Please note that the current key for <org>-validator 
  will no longer be accepted after resetting its key. Are you certain you want to continue?
--> If you have the previously generated validator.pem saved and available THEN DONT CONTINUE - USE THE OLD ONE ITSELF
--> Let us assume we have lost the old one, then continue - press the button "Reset Key"

-->--> SAVE TO A SAFE LOCATION the key that shows up as <organization>-validator.pem --> like g-validator.pem

---------------
<USERID>.PEM
---------------
Go to user profile page
  From the 'signed in as <user name>' --> drop down --> My Profile
  
You will see the 'public key' listed in the bottom right side
--> DO NOT USE THAT PUBLIC KEY --> YOU NEED THE PRIVATE KEY
--> click 'reset key' and that will pop-up a new private key
Copy that private key into <userid>.pem

Copy the key and SAVE TO A SAFE LOCATION as <userid>.pem
NOTE - userid is the userid used to logon to the chef-server (it could be your LAN ID if LDAP authenticated in your company)

==================
USING THESE FILES - BASICS - BOOTSTRAP IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION
==================
Prep in Bill's kitchen:
Copy all contents of chef-starter.zip to under O:\

This should create a folder O:\.chef with knife.rb, chef-userid.pem and chef-org-validator.pem
Usually knife.rb shows cookbook-directory as ..\cookbooks as the default location
For convenience, you can place the .pem files of server private keys also in this O:\.chef directory

------------------------------
UPLOAD COOKBOOK TO CHEF SERVER
------------------------------
O:\>knife cookbook upload test1
Uploading test1        [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.

Verify - Logon to chef server --> go to 'Policy' tab 
                --> click 'Cookbooks' on left hand panel --> you should see the cookbook in right hand side panel

===============================
BOOTSTRAP CLIENT TO CHEF SERVER
===============================

https://docs.chef.io/install_bootstrap.html
Also see Chef-Notes-Advanced.txt

Two methods:
  Bootstrapping directly from guest
  Bootstrapping from workstation
  
---------------------------------
Bootstrapping directly from guest
---------------------------------
1.	Download chef-starter.zip into ~/cookbooks/<node cookbook folder> like ~/cookbooks/node1
2.	Logon to client VM by ‘vagrant ssh’
3.	Sudo to ‘root’ in client
4.	Unzip chef-starter.zip into /root folder
5.	This will create chef-repo under /root and  .chef folder under /root/chef-repo, and knife.rb, 
			the pem files etc will be placed under that .chef folder
6. BOOTSTRAP:  
    Logon/sudo as root
    Go to /root/chef-repo folder
   	a.	Bootstrap without runlist:
   	
   	    With NAT network address:
				# knife bootstrap 10.0.2.15 –ssh-user root –ssh-password root –node-name node1  
				
				With other network address:
				# knife bootstrap 192.168.65.10 –ssh-user root –ssh-password root –node-name node1  
				
  	b.	Bootstrap with runlist:  
  	
  	    With NAT network address:
				# knife bootstrap 10.0.2.15 –ssh-user root –ssh-password root –node-name node1 –run-list ‘recipe[recipe1]’
				
				With other network address:
				# knife bootstrap 192.168.65.10 –ssh-user root –ssh-password root –node-name node1 –run-list ‘recipe[recipe1]’
				
8.	On client recipes are synched to /var/chef/cache/cookbooks (or /root/chef-repo/cookbooks/ ??)
