- Create a json file with the entries
  File: E:\datbags\pwv_users.json  (could be in other directories also)
  Content:  {"pwvu1":"pwvu1p"}
  
- Create the vault 
NOTE: Replace u1,u2 with approrpriate users that can edit this vault
      If the directory names give error, fix that or run from that directory itself with ./pwv_users.json

Breakdown:
$ knife vault create <vault name> <item name> -A <admin user list> -M client -S <node list> <json file>
$ knife vault create pwv_users pwvu1item -A u1,u2 -M client -S 'name:*' -J E:\databags\pwv_users.json
NOTE: 'item name' could be same as the first field in the json for simplicity

- - - - - 
- List the vaults: ('pwv_users' is the vault)
$ knife vault show pwv_users -M client
testuser --> is the item
$

G:\.chef>knife vault show credentials testuser -M client
id:       testuser
testuser: testpassword

- List as data bag (with unencrypted content):
G:\.chef>knife data bag show credentials testuser
