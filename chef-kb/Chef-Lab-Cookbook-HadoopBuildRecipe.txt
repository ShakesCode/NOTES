Hadoop Node Build using Chef
VM Details:
VM Hostname	vm-hadoop1
IP Address	10.0.2.15
Host IP (laptop)	10.0.2.2

Environment:
Vagrant, Berkshelf, Chef-solo 

Create VM:
Go to ~/cookbooks and do:   berks cookbook vm-hadoop2	
Go to ~/cookbooks/vm-hadoop2 and edit Vagrantfile:
Comment the line of config.vm.network :private_network (as it did not seem to work due to lack of LAR)
Uncomment virtualbox configuration section and reduce memory to 512 from 1024
Edit hostname to vm-hadoop2 from vm-hadoop2-berkshelf

Edit box image details: 
Change config.vm.box line which says “xxxxxxx” to “yyy-xxxxx”
Add line config.vm.box_download_insecure = “yyy-xxxx”

Change config.vm.box_url to the latest in repository.
Go to  ~/cookbooks/vm-hadoop2
Do ‘vagrant up’

Do ‘vagrant ssh’ to logon to the box and validate creation
Check in virtualbox if the machine has come up	
Vagrant user in the VM:
/etc/sudoers on the VM has the following line for vagrant user:
vagrant ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWORD:ALL
That is, vagrant user can do root and other users operations without password	

Copy Hadoop distribution:
Download hadoop installer file

Copy it to ~/cookbooks/vm-hadoop2 folder

This folder will show up in the VM as /vagrant and the VM now can access it for installation
	

Create Hadoop Install Recipe:

Recipes are created in ~/cookbooks/vm-hadoop2/recipes	
Create a file hadoop-swinstall.rb in recipes folder with the following content:

group hadoop

user ‘hadoop’ do
  comment ‘Hadoop software owner’
  gid 'hadoop'
  home '/home/hadoop'
  shell '/bin/bash'
  password 'hadoop’
end

bash 'install_hadoop' do
  user 'root'
  cwd '/usr/local'

  code <<-EOF
  
  tar -zxf /vagrant/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
  dir=`ls –l | grep hadoop | tail -1`

 chown –R hadoop:hadoop $dir

  rm -i hadoop
  ln –s $dir hadoop
 
  EOF
end

bash ‘config_hadoop_user_env’ do
  user 'hadoop'
  cwd '/home/hadoop’

  code <<-EOF
  
# Set the Hadoop Related Environment variables
echo “export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop” >> .bashrc
echo “export HADOOP_STREAMING=$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/tools/lib/Hadoop-streaming-2.6.0.jar” >> .bashrc
echo “export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin” >> .bashrc

  EOF
end

	https://docs.chef.io/resource_bash.html - for embedding cd, untar etc
bash 'install_something' do
  user 'root'
  cwd '/tmp'
  code <<-EOH
  wget http://www.example.com/tarball.tar.gz
  tar -zxf tarball.tar.gz
  cd tarball
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  EOH
end

Run the recipe:
Edit vagrantfile adding the run list:
On the laptop, edit ~/cookbooks/vm-hadoop2/Vagrantfile to reflect run-list:

chef.run_list = [“recipe[vm-hadoop2::default]”, “recipe[vm-hadoop2::hadoop-swinstall]”]
	
Run the recipe:
In ‘cookbooks/vm-hadoop2’ folder, do ‘vagrant provision’	
Check in the hadoop VM if install was successful:
Go to ‘cookbooks/vm-hadoop2’
Logon to the VM by ‘vagrant ssh’
Go to the /usr/local folder on the VM and check for the hadoop installation folder and soft-link	

Bootstrap the node to chef server:
Steps general reference:  Follow document Chef-Lab-Advanced.doc
