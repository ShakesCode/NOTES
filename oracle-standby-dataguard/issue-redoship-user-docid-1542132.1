Redo shipping and FAL requests are failing between the Primary and Standby sites. 

Enabling a trace of the event 16191 and reproducing the error using a defer and re-enable of the log archive shipping destination in the Primary site shows the following errors appear when a login attempt is made by the Primary to the standby site.

The ARCH background process is attempting to connect to the standby site and failing reporting the errors in the trace file, 1031 insufficent privileges, 1017 and 16191.

CHANGES

 In this case the password file has been recreated and redistributed to the Primary and Standby sites and the RDBMS parameter redo_transport_user is set and SYSOPER has not been granted to the user specified in redo_transport_user.  Another scenario would be where the environment is a brand new environment where the parameter redo_transport_user has been implemented and SYSOPER has not been granted to the user specified in redo_transport_user.

CAUSE

Examination of the alert log in the Primary and identifying the last startup attempts parameter settings shows that the parameter.  In this case the parameter is set to a database user called REDOSHIP.

redo_transport_user = "REDOSHIP"

OR

revealing the current setting for the parameter using the following command shows that a username has been specified for this parameter

SQL> show parameter redo_transport_user



Looking at the contents of the password file through the view v$pwfile_users, this user REDOSHIP is not present and as such has not been granted the SYSOPER privilege required to facilitate log shipping.


select * from v$pwfile_users;

USERNAME          SYSDB   SYSOP  SYSAS
-------------------------------------------------
SYS               TRUE    TRUE   FALSE
 
 


SOLUTION

The following documentation details the privileges that must be granted to the user specified by the parameter redo_transport_user. SYSOPER privilege must be granted to the user specified through redo_transport_user which will result in an entry being created in the password file for this user and therefor allow the databases in the standby configuration to connect to one another for shipping of the redo stream.

          6.2.1.2 Redo Transport Authentication Using a Password File

 

1. Grant SYSOPER to the user REDOSHIP specified in the parameter redo_transport_user.

SQL> grant SYSOPER to REDOSHIP
 


NOTE : From 12c onwards we can include SYSDG privilege, so REDO user can have these privileges SYSDG, SYSOPER, SYSDBA

2. Defer the destination user to ship redo and re-enable this to check connections can now be made between the sites.

SQL> alter system set log_archive_dest_state_X=defer scope=both sid='*'
SQL> alter system set log_archive_dest_state_X=enable scope=both sid='*'
 
 Where X is the number associated with the destination used to ship redo from the primary to the standby site.
