--> GOOD SUMMARY OF DATASETS, PRODUCER, CONSUMER AND API GENERATION
Hollow manages datasets which are built by a single producer, and disseminated to one or many consumers for read-only access.
A dataset changes over time. The timeline for a changing dataset can be broken down into discrete data states, each of which 
is a complete snapshot of the data at a particular point in time.

The producer and the consumers handle datasets via a state engine that is transitioned between data states. A producer uses a 
write state engine and a consumer uses a read state engine.
