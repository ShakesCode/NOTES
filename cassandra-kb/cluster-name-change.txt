CASSANDRA CLUSTER NAME
======================
https://support.datastax.com/hc/en-us/articles/205289825-Change-Cluster-Name-

In CQLSH use the following command: 
UPDATE system.local SET cluster_name = '<cluster_name>' where key='local';

In casandra.yaml make sure that the cluster_name is the exact same as what was entered in CQLSH.

Run: /usr/bin/nodetool flush system 
(to flush memtable to the commitlog so you do not lose any writes to your cluster, as well as clearing the system cache.)

Restart cassandra
  If Datastax:
  restart dse: sudo service dse restart
  
  If Apache on Centos:
  /etc/init.d/cassandra restart
  
Verify in CQLSH the cluster_name has been changed. select cluster_name from system.local;
