What ports does Cassandra use?
By default, Cassandra uses 7000 for cluster communication (7001 if SSL is enabled), 9042 for native protocol clients, 
and 7199 for JMX. The internode communication and native protocol ports are configurable in the Cassandra Configuration File. 

The JMX port is configurable in cassandra-env.sh (through JVM options). All ports are TCP.

Configuring firewall port access 

If you have a firewall running on the nodes in your Cassandra cluster, you must open up the following ports to allow bi-directional communication among the nodes, including certain Cassandra ports. If this isnâ€™t done, when you start Cassandra on a node, the node acts as a standalone database server rather than joining the database cluster.
