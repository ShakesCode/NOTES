What ports does Cassandra use?
By default, Cassandra uses 7000 for cluster communication (7001 if SSL is enabled), 9042 for native protocol clients, 
and 7199 for JMX. The internode communication and native protocol ports are configurable in the Cassandra Configuration File. 

The JMX port is configurable in cassandra-env.sh (through JVM options). All ports are TCP.
