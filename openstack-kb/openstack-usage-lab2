OPENSTACK USAGE LAB
==============================================

LOGON
Logon to openstack site - in browser
It first shows the limits and usage pie-charts

CREATE NETWORK
Name- nw0
Subnet- sn0 (or nw0-sn0)
IP- 192.168.0.0/24 - in CIDR format
IPV version- IPV4
Gateway - 192.168.0.1 (earlier, had disabled initiallly)
Enable DHCP (earlier, had disabled DHCP)
Allocation pool- 192.168.0.100,192.168.0.199

Now, in the Network Topology view, you should see nw0

CREATE ROUTER
Step1: Choose the external vlan network to use - like 1770 (used one ending with 0 to use with nw0)
  Now, in the Network Topology view, you should see the router showing attached to the external-vlan

Step2: In the topology view, click/hover on the router image
Choose 'add interface'
Choose nw0
NOTE: Without this, you cannot associate a machine with a floating IP (you will get error 'no ports available')

CREATE SECURITY GROUP
Go to 'compute' section
Go to 'Access & Security' --> 'Security Groups'
Create a new security group - 'custom1'
Set it such that SSH, HTTP and all TCP, all ICMP are open for 'ingress' (that is, incoming traffic)

CREATE KEY PAIR
Go to compute --> Access & security --> Key Pairs
Choose 'import key pair' (as I want to use an existing key pair)
Give it a name
Copy and paste the existing public-key

NOTE:  Later, chose the option of Openstack to create a key-pair by itself - it downloaded the private key, did not give the public key on the screen.
Copied the keys to C:\osct --> where the client tools have been installed

ALLOCATE A FLOATING IP
(for use with a machine later)
Go to compute --> Access & security --> Floating IPs
Click 'allocate IP to project'
Choose the 'pool' - one of the external-vlan's choosen earlier for the router
(allocate one or more IPs for use later)

API ACCESS
Go to compute --> Access & security --> API Access
Download Openstack RC file
Download EC2 credential
Save these files in some place on your laptop

Then, 'view credentials'
Note down what you see if necessary

CREATE A VM - LINUX
Compute --> Instances
Click 'Launch Instance'

Details section:
Choose availability zone (like 'any')
Give an instance name - rhel1 (machine name)
Choose flavor
Choose boot from image
Choose image of RHEL version

Access & Security section:
Choose key pair to use
Choose security group to use - custom1 group

Networking section:
Choose nw0 (or other if you have created)

Post Creation section:
Paste the script or provide the file to run (did not choose any as no need now)

Advanced Options section:
Disk Partition - left it as automatic

Click 'launch' - vm should be ready in a few minutes

ASSIGN FLOATING IP TO VM
Go to compute --> instances 
Choose the 'Action' - Associate Floating IP
Choose one of the IPs created earlier
Choose the network port in the port box

RETRIEVE PASSWORD  (TBD - NOT WORKING)
(somehow this is not working - it is not showing the encrypted password and where to enter they private key)
http://dev.cloudwatt.com/en/blog/horizon-icehouse-retrieve-a-password-generated-by-an-instance.html

nova get-password <machine name> <private key file name>
--> This is not working from CMD prompt --> gives NULL on screen

LOGON TO LINUX MACHINE - VIA SSH FROM GIT-BASH
*** THIS WORKED ***
Syntax: ssh -i <keyfile name> cloud-user or ec2-user@<floatingip>
NOTE: cloud-user or ec2-user or other such user would have been set up in the image already - CHECK FROM YOUR OPENSTACK ADMIN

ssh -i openstack1.pem cloud-user@10.20.30.40 (or other IP)
--> This will take you to the 'cloud-user' account
--> From it, you can 'sudo su - root' without password

LOGON TO LINUX MACHINE - VIA CONSOLE ON OPENSTACK WEB-UI
Click on the instance name in the instances view
Click on 'console' --> Click here to show only console

--> You will get the black Login: screen now
--> However, cloud-user's password is not known - so cannot logon yet

LOGON TO LINUX MACHINE - VIA PUTTY (TBD)

PING LINUX MACHINE
It was already pingable via floating IP

PING WINDOWS MACHINE
Initially it was not pingable via floating IP
Logged on to the console and set the firewall rule for 'public' network to allow all incoming connections

LOGON TO WINDOWS MACHINE - VIA CONSOLE
Click on the instance name in the instances view
Click on 'console' --> Click here to show only console

--> This will take you to Windows server console - ALREADY LOGGED ON as 'Administrator'
--> Now, use Start --> Control Panel - to create new users (created one 'username' user  with a password)

LOGON TO WINDOWS MACHINE - VIA MSTSC OR RDP (TBD)
At present the floating IP is not pingable from laptop
