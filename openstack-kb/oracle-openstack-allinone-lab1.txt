==================================
VM IMAGE DOWNLOAD AND STARTUP
==================================

---------------------
Download and Unzip VM
---------------------
Download the VM image OpenStackHOL.gz
Copy the image file to a standard directory for VMs: C:\Local\Openstack\Oracle-VM-allInOne-1
(Copying to the Virtualbox's default VM location C:\Users\username\VirtualBox itself will not really help any better - 
  as Virtualbox actually creates vmdk etc in a folder in this default location itself)
Unzip using express-zip or other unzip tool into a subfolder OpenStackHOL
Rename the unzipped file OpenStackHOL in that subfolder adding the extension 'ova' OpenStackHOL.ova
(this rename is necessary for Virtualbox to recognize it)

-----------------
Startup VM
-----------------
Double-click on it (assuming it has gotten recognized by virtualbox - otherwise go to Virtualbox and open that file with it)
It will bring up an "Appliance Settings" page - note down if needed, and then click to proceed
--> need to add another network (leave first one NAT as is) 
    - use host-only or internal (when we dont have local-admin-rights)

This will kind of extract the file into vmdk etc into the Virtualbox default folder (takes a few min)
--> C:\Users\username\VirtualBox VMs\OpenStackHOL --> probably I could have renamed it in the "appliance settings" page

Startup VM in virtualbox 
- Upon startup, it wont immediately give login screen - Alt-F2 for login screen

Configuration (default): VM name - OpenStakHOL, RAM 4GB, one network adapter, two hard disk controller
                          Oracle VM Server 3.3.1,  Oracle Linux???

NOTE: This may have keyboard capture enabled.  Right-ctrl is the release key.
      --> Upon release you can toggle-back and forth and it will not capture until you click the screen again

-------------
Login
-------------
Upon startup, it wont immediately give login screen 
- Alt-F2 for login screen

Username: root,  Password: password

$ uname -a
--> shows VM server version info
$ hostname
--> shows localhost.localdomain

------------------------
SETUP IP ADDRESS
------------------------
http://www.cloudibee.com/network-bonding-modes/

The image-how-to-use document says 'get ip address of bond0'.
However ifconfig does not show any IP address. That is because bond0 is configured for DHCP which we dont have now.

Edit the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0 with the following lines:
  Comment out BOOTPROT="dhcp"
  
  Add:
  IPADDR=192.168.10.10
  NETMASK=255.255.255.0
  BOOTPROTO=none
  
  Keep:
  ONBOOT=yes and other settings
  

Edit eth0 - /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
  NOTE: All these settings already existed
  DEVICE=eth0 
  BOOTPROTO=none 
  HWADDR="whatever there is"
  ONBOOT=yes 
  # Settings for Bond 
  MASTER=bond0 
  SLAVE=yes

Restart network
$ modprobe bonding
$ service network restart

Check IP Address
$ ifconfig

bond0 shows IP as 192.168.10.10 and broadcast as 192.168.10.255
eth0 does not show any IP - use bond0 IP

------------------------
Enable console
------------------------
To be able to see the instance console we will need to update Nova with the
bond0 IP, to do that we need to run the following commands:
$ openstack-config --set /etc/nova/nova.conf DEFAULT novncproxy_base_url http://<BOND0 IP>:6080/vnc_auto.html
$ service openstack-nova-compute restart

------------------------
Openstack Admin Password
------------------------
Open the file keystonerc_admin to get passwords and URLs etc

OS Username = admin
OS tenant name = admin
OS password = 2b28b42bf62e49cc --> default value (how to change it???)
OS Auth URL = http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2.0/

-----------------------
Changing admin password
-----------------------
Logon to the console using the initial password.

This is not working right: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16768272/openstack-change-admin-password-for-the-dashboard
  $ export OS_SERVICE_TOKEN=$servicetoken(/etc/keystone/keystone.conf)
  $ export OS_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=$http://ipoftheserver/v2.0
  then use this syntax to change the password
  $ keystone user-password-update --pass <password> <user id>

-----------------
To Shutdown
-----------------
# halt
