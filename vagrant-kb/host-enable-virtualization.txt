ENABLE VIRTUALIZATION IN HOST MACHINE
=====================================

The host machine should have virtualization enabled - otherwise VMs cannot start.

To fix this i had to do some configurations in the system BIOS. I had to turn on the intel VT-x setting. 
And please check for AMD-V setting as well. These settings help hardware virtualization.

I had the same problem on windows 10 and the solution for me was to enable Intel Virtualization.

I'm afraid I can't give you specific instructions, as far as the BIOS menu options vary from computer to computer depending 
on the manufacturer. However, generally you should follow these steps:

1-Power on the machine and open the BIOS.

2- Open the Processor submenu The processor settings menu may be hidden in the Chipset, 
   Advanced CPU Configuration or Northbridge.

3-Enable Intel Virtualization Technology (also known as Intel VT) or AMD-V depending on the brand of the processor.

4- Save the changes and restart.
