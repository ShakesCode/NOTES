Installing KDE Software Compilation on an Ubuntu system.

How to Install
There are different packages to be installed to acquire Kubuntu from an Ubuntu installation depending on which 
packages you want. Below are the three possible choices, or "routes", to go down; the packages below are metapackages -- 
they depend upon other, "real", packages, and with their installation they pull them in. For details on package installation
methods, see the wiki page InstallingSoftware. The options are as follows:

(i) kubuntu-desktop -- This is the recommended metapackage to install; the full Kubuntu installation, with all the Kubuntu
recommended packages. This includes LibreOffice, Kontact, Konversation, Amarok, K3B, and others.

(ii) kde-full -- This will install the following KDE packages: kdegames, kdeaccessibility, kdeplasma-addons, kdeadmin,
kdeartwork, kdegraphics, kdemultimedia, kdenetwork, kdepim, kdesdk, kdeutils, kdewebdev, and the kde-plasma-desktop
metapackage (see details below).

(iii) kde-plasma-desktop --- This will install the core -- the bare-minimum required-- of KDE. That is, kdebase-apps, 
kdebase-runtime, kdebase-workspace and kdm.
