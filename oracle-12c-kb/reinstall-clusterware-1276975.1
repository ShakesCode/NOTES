GOAL

The goal of this document is to provide a step by step approach to re-install Oracle 11gR2 Grid Infrastructure (for environments where Oracle Clusterware files are stored in ASM) without affecting the RDBMS Installations and configured databases.

Note:  If your Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) and Voting disk (VD) files are contained in the same ASM diskgroup as your data, please be EXTREMELY careful when executing these steps to avoid potential data loss.

 

SOLUTION

0)  IF your OCR and VD files are contained in the same ASM diskgroup as your data, allocate/prepare a new disk partition that can be used to make a new ASM diskgroup that will exclusively store the new OCR and VD files upon reinstallation of Grid Infrastructure.


1)   Before performing the below steps, please make an export of the OCR contents (if OCR is accessible) which can be used to import the OCR contents once the re-installation is complete

<GRID_HOME>/bin/ocrconfig -export <file_name>

2)   Shutdown all the databases and all other resources running on all the nodes of the cluster

<GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl stop crs
 

3) De-configure the clusterware on the remote nodes (typically 'node2'-'noden')

On all remote nodes, as root on Unix platforms and as the (current) Grid Infrastructure software owner on Windows, execute the following:

Unix example:

#<GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose

Windows Example:
`set path=%path%;C:\app\11.2.0\grid\perl\bin

perl <GRID_HOME>\crs\install\rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose

 
4) On the local node (typically 'node1'), as root on Unix platforms and as the (current) Grid Infrastructure software owner on Windows, execute the following:
a)  ONLY EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND IF YOUR OCR and VD files ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THEIR OWN DISKGROUP:

Unix example:
# <GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose -lastnode

Windows example:

set path=%path%;C:\app\11.2.0\grid\perl\bin

perl <GRID_HOME>\crs\install\rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose -lastnode

NOTE:  Beginning with 11.2.0.3, the '-keepdg' option may be used with rootcrs.pl -deconfig. This will preserve the diskgroup and can be used with the -lastnode option.

 b)  IF YOUR OCR AND VD FILES ARE CONTAINED IN A DISKGROUP THAT ALSO CONTAINS DATA:

Unix example:

#<GRID_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose

Windows Example:

set path=%path%;C:\app\11.2.0\grid\perl\bin

perl <GRID_HOME>\crs\install\rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force -verbose

 

Note:  By omitting the '-lastnode' flag, you will preserve the entire diskgroup wherein the original OCR and VD files are contained. These must be left in place in order to maintain the integrity of the data that shares the same diskgroup.
 

5)  Deinstall Oracle Grid Infrastructure software

Unix example:

<GRID_HOME>/deinstall/deinstall

Windows example:

<GRID_HOME>\deinstall\deinstall

NOTE:  For the most part and in most cases, selecting the default value for all 'deinstall' prompts is sufficient for a thorough deinstall

 

6)    Once the de-installation is complete, use the Oracle Universal Installer to reinstall Oracle Grid Infrastructure making sure to indicate the new diskgroup name for cases where a new / separate diskgroup will be created for OCR and VD storage


7)    As root, Run root.sh on each node (Unix only, you may skip this step for Windows platforms)

<GRID_HOME/bin/root.sh
 
8)    Ensure that the Clusterware is running fine on all the nodes following the installation and after the root.sh execution

Unix: <GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl check cluster -all 
Windows: <GRID_HOME>\bin\crsctl check cluster -all

For Grid Infrastructure Standalone: <GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl check has

For Grid Infrastructure Standalone, it's possible you will need to re-create your ora.asm resource using the following commands:

Unix:

<GRID_HOME>/bin/srvctl add asm
<GRID_HOME>/bin/srvctl start asm

Windows:

<GRID_HOME>\bin\srvctl add asm
<GRID_HOME>\bin\srvctl start asm

 

9)    Run the ASMCA and mount all the database diskgroups

Unix: <GRID_HOME>/bin/asmca
Windows: <GRID_HOME>\bin\asmca


"crsctl stat res -t" command should show all the diskgroups with TARGET and STATE of ONLINE

Note:  Simply mounting the diskgroups (and/or restoring the OCR backup (see next step) will cause the diskgroup resources to be added to the OCR

10)   Once the Clusterware is running on all the nodes, restore the OCR backup that was taken at step 1, to import all the resources, that were configured earlier


a)      Shutdown the CRS on all the nodes.

Unix: <GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl stop crs 
Windows:<GRID_HOME>\bin\crsctl stop crs

b)      Start CRS on 'node1' in exclusive mode.

Unix: <GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl start crs -excl
Windows: <GRID_HOME>\bin\crsctl start crs -excl


Note: If we are running 11.2.0.2, please use "<GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl start crs -excl -nocrs" and move to step (d)


c)      Check whether crsd is running. If it is, stop it by running the following command as root

Unix:
<GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl stat res -init -t
<GRID_HOME/bin/crsctl stop res ora.crsd -init
Windows:
<GRID_HOME>\bin\crsctl stat res -init -t
<GRID_HOME\bin\crsctl stop res ora.crsd -init

 

d)      Import the OCR contents from backup

Unix:
<GRID_HOME>/bin/ocrconfig -import file_name
<GRID_HOME>/bin/ocrcheck
Windows:

<GRID_HOME>\bin\ocrconfig -import file_name
<GRID_HOME>\bin\ocrcheck


e)      Stop the clusterware on 'node1' and start it on all the nodes

Unix:
<GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl stop crs -f
<GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl start crs
Windows:
<GRID_HOME>\bin\crsctl stop crs -f
<GRID_HOME>\bin\crsctl start crs

11)    If a good OCR backup is not available, we will need to run the SRVCTL commands to add the resources to the OCR. Be sure that we have added all the resources necessary to run the environment


srvctl add database -d <database_name> -o <oracle_home> -a "asm diskgroup list"
srvctl add instance -d <database_name> -i <inst_name> -n <nodename>
srvctl add service -d <db_unique_name> -s <service_name> -r "<preferred_list>" -a "<available_list>" 

srvctl start database -d <database name> 
srvctl start service -d <database name> -s <service name>

srvctl status service -d <database name> -s <service name>
srvctl status database -d <database name>

12)  Confirm that all the resources are running fine

Unix: <GRID_HOME>/bin/crsctl stat res -t
Windows: <GRID_HOME\bin\crsctl stat res -t
