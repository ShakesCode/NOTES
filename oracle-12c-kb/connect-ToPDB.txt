ORACLE 12C - 
CONNECTING TO PDB:
(NOTE - To connect as sys or other elevated local users, use the same methods as below, but use 'as sysdba' where necessary)

Method 1:  
alter session set container = pdbName;

For other methods, you need to know the service-name for the PDB:
Get the service name for the PDB:
SELECT name || ' '|| pdb
  FROM   v$services
  ORDER BY name;

or by doing "lsnrctl services LISTENER" and locating service for the  PDB.

Method 2a:  Using host and port without SCAN
connect user/pass@//host:port/pdbServiceName 
or 
sqlplus user/pass@//host:port/pdbServiceName 

Method 2b:  Using host and port with SCAN
Unix$> sqlplus localuser/password@//cluster-scan:scanPort/pdbServiceName
SQL> connect localuser/password@//cluster-scan:scanPort/pdbServiceName

Method 3:  Using tns entry
Make Tns entry - with hostname or scan:
With hostname and non-scan listener:
PDB1 =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = hostname)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = pdbServiceName)
    )
  )

With Scan:
PDB1 =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = scan-name)(PORT = 1522))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = pdbServiceName)
    )
  )

Then connect as follows:
“connect user/pass@PDB1” where PDB1 is the TNS alias
or “sqlplus  user/pass@PDB1”
