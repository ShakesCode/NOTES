2.1 Patch Installation Prerequisites
You must satisfy the conditions in the following sections before applying the patch:

•OPatch Utility Information
•OCM Configuration
•Validation of Oracle Inventory
•Download and Unzip the Patch

2.1.1 OPatch Utility Information

You must use the OPatch utility version 12.1.0.1.6 or later to apply this patch. Oracle recommends that you use the latest released
OPatch version for 12.1 releases, which is available for download from My Oracle Support patch 6880880 by selecting ARU link for the
12.1.0.1.0 release. It is recommended that you download the Opatch utility and the patch in a shared location to be able to access them
from any node in the cluster for the patch application on each node.

When patching the GI Home, a shared location on ACFS only needs to be unmounted on the node where the GI Home is being patched.

The new opatch utility should be updated in all the Oracle RAC database homes and the GI home that are being patched.

To update Opatch, use the following instructions:

1.Download the OPatch utility to a temporary directory.

2.For each Oracle RAC database home and the GI home that are being patched, run the following commands as the home owner 
to extract the OPatch utility.

$ unzip <OPATCH-ZIP> -d <ORACLE_HOME>
$ <ORACLE_HOME>/OPatch/opatch version

The version output of the previous command should be 12.1.0.1.6 or later.

For information about OPatch documentation, including any known issues, 
see My Oracle Support Document 293369.1 OPatch documentation list.
 
2.1.2 OCM Configuration

The OPatch utility will prompt for your OCM (Oracle Configuration Manager) response file when it is run. 
You should enter a complete path of OCM response file if you already have created this in your environment. 
OCM response file is required and is not optional.

If you do not have the OCM response file (ocm.rsp), 
see the following My Oracle Support Document 966023.1 How To Create An OCM Response File For Opatch Silent Installation.
