Goal



 

This Article helps in creating the OCM response file to run opatch in silent mode

Scenario:
While installing patch in silent mode, opatch tool prompts User for OCM configuration, this makes Opatch to break the silent 
install process and park patch apply for User response. (And this violates silent install feature).

However, this can be solved via creating an OCM response file and pass all the parameters via this file while silent install. 
Opatch reads this file while installing in silent does not prompt for OCM credentials.

 

What is OCM (Oracle Configuration Manager?)

The Oracle Configuration Manager (OCM) is a tool which proactively monitor the customers Oracle environment and provide this information to My Oracle Support (MOS). The Data collected from the customer environment is uploaded to Oracle Customer Configuration Repository and replicates this to My Oracle Support so that customer/support can view it. Additionally MOS analyzes the Data collected and  informs respective customer about alerts and advise health checks. For more information refer Note:369619.1

 

Solution

Pre-requirements to use  opatch silent

1) Download and install  latest opatch tool (ignore this if already done)

2) Create response file for  OCM  

3) Use the OCM response file for all opatch silent application

However, If plan to use the ocm.rsp file with other OH - like, GRID, CRS, ORACLE_HOME, then please make sure this file is 
placed in accessible path and have 775 file permission (i.e $chmod  775 ocm.rsp)

 

========= refer below for detailed steps =============

 

1)  Download and install latest opatch tool (recommended)

Patch # 6880880
Select a Release: 10.2  -OR-  11.1 -OR-  11.2 -OR-  12.1 

 

2) How to create response file for OCM 

Note : the location of OCM executable is  "$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/ocm/bin/emocmrsp"

 


syntax : 
% export ORACLE_HOME=<my_oracle_home_path>
% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/ocm/bin/emocmrsp  -no_banner -output <specify_the_location>/file.rsp

* creates the response in location specified by the parameter "-output"
* running without "-output <specify_the_location>/file.rsp"  creates the file in current directory with default name(ocm.rsp)

Refer  the options below to create a ocm response file

Option 1 :  Create the response file while keeping OCM turned OFF (Yes, OCM can be turned off. 
use this  options if you are not sure about OCM )


% export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/11.2/db1
% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/ocm/bin/emocmrsp -no_banner -output /u02/ocm.rsp

The OCM configuration response file (/u02/ocm.rsp) was successfully created. <<

Option 2  : Create the response file while keep OCM turn ON / Active (Yes, OCM can be turned ON. use this  "options 1" 
if you are not sure about OCM )


% export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/11.2/db1
% $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/ocm/bin/emocmrsp -no_banner -output /u02/ocm.rsp

The OCM configuration response file (/u02/ocm.rsp) was successfully created.  <<<

Note 1 : we can preserve the file “/u02/ocm.rsp” ( rename if needed)  and could be used  with other similar ORACLE_HOME/setup/machine 
Note 2 : Also applicable to Grid home patching (opatch -auto -ocmrf   instead "-silent" )

However, If plan to use the ocm.rsp file with other OH - like, GRID, CRS, ORACLE_HOME, then please make sure this file is placed 
in accessible path and have 775 file permission (i.e $chmod  775 ocm.rsp)

 

 

3)  Use the OCM response file for all "opatch -silent"   operations

 


Assume applying patch 12345


% cd 12345
% opatch apply -silent -ocmrf <path_to_response_file>

Example: % opatch apply -silent -ocmrf /u02/ocm.rsp

 Additional Examples (Showing command usage for  CPU/SPU/PSU/ "opatch auto" )

1) User below for CPU/SPU apply
% opatch napply -silent -ocmrf /u02/ocm.rsp

2)Use below for  PSU apply
% opatch apply -silent -ocmrf /u02/ocm.rsp

3)GRID patching command changed sightly as below 
% opatch auto -ocmrf /u02/ocm.rsp

Note1 : File “/u02/ocm.rsp” (could be renamed as per requirement )  can be used with other opatch -silent when used with other 
ORACLE_HOME/setup/machine, however, mention this file while invoking opatch -silent 
Note3: Also applicable to Grid home patching (opatch -auto -ocmrf   instead "-silent" )

However, If plan to use the ocm.rsp file with other OH - like, GRID, CRS, ORACLE_HOME, then please make sure this file is placed 
in accessible path and have 775 file permission (i.e $chmod  775 ocm.rsp)


 

Note :- Execution of opatch doesn't require ocm.rsp ,starting with OPatch version  11.2.0.3.14 , 12.1.0.2.12 and higher  .
As OCM is not bundled with OPatch .
