If 'move' was used to create new PDB in destination, remove the source non-CDB database completely.
If 'copy' was used, then the source non-CDB database will still be usable. Decide what to do.
If 'nocopy' was used - it is tricky - the source database would be 'corrupt' of sorts.
  Then decide which files to remove and which to keep.
  Remove source DB configuration in crs, dbs folder, dump dests etc.
