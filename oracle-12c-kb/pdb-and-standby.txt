If we create a PDB on primary  CDB, then Data Guard create this PDB in standby CDB automatically. Oracle Multitenant option also supports some news in Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1.0.2.0). So, PDB Inclusion in Standby CDBs feature is coming with Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1.0.2).

The STANDBYS clause of the CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE statement specifies whether the new PDB is included in standby CDBs. You can specify one of the following values for the STANDBYS clause:

ALL includes the new PDB in all of the standby CDBs.
NONE excludes the new PDB from all of the standby CDBs.
