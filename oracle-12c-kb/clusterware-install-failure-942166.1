Generic Linux
PURPOSE

This note provides steps to proceed from failed 11gR2 Grid Infrastructure installation.

Similar procedure for 10gR1, 10gR2 or 11gR1 available in note 239998.1 and note 399482.1 

If upgrade to 11.2 GI fails, refer to note 969254.1for details.

If 11.2 GI has been up and running and need to be deconfigured/deinstalled/reconfigured/reinstalled, refer to note 1377349.1 and note 1354258.1 


SCOPE

This document is intended for Oracle Clusterware/Oracle RAC Database Administrators and Oracle support engineers. 

DETAILS

 

A. OUI Failure

Case applies here is when runInstaller fails before user is prompted to execute rootupgrade.sh.

Refer to note 1056322.1 for solution details.



B. GI Standalone Deconfigure and Reconfigure (Oracle Restart):


  To deconfigure:

    As root, execute "$GRID_HOME/crs/install/roothas.pl -deconfig -force -verbose"

    If it fails, please disable GI, reboot the node and try the same command:

      As root, execute "$GRID_HOME/bin/crsctl disable has"
      As root, reboot the node; once the node comes backup, execute above deconfigure command again.

  To reconfigure:

    As root, execute "$GRID_HOME/root.sh"      




C. GI Cluster Deconfigure and Reconfigure

Identify cause of root.sh failure by reviewing logs in $GRID_HOME/cfgtoollogs/crsconfig and $GRID_HOME/log, once cause is identified and problem is fixed, deconfigure and reconfigure with steps below - keep in mind that you will need wait till each step finishes successfully before move to next one:

Step 0: For 11.2.0.2 and above, root.sh is restartable.

Once cause is identified and the problem is fixed, root.sh can be executed again on the failed node. If it succeeds, continue with your planned installation procedure; otherwise as root sequentially execute "$GRID_HOME/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -verbose -deconfig -force" and $GRID_HOME/root.sh on local node, if it succeeds, continue with your planned installation procedure, otherwise proceed to next step (Step 1) of the note.

Step 1: As root, run "$GRID_HOME/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -verbose -deconfig -force" on all nodes, except the last one.

Step 2: As root, run "$GRID_HOME/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -verbose -deconfig -force -lastnode" on last node. This command will zero out OCR, Voting Disk and the ASM diskgroup for OCR and Voting Disk


    Note:

    a. Step1 and 2 can be skipped on node(s) where root.sh haven't been executed this time.

    b. Step1 and 2 should remove checkpoint file. To verify:

          ls -l $ORACLE_BASE/Clusterware/ckptGridHA_.xml

    If it's still there, please remove it manually with "rm" command on all nodes

    c. If GPNP profile is different between nodes/setup, clean it up on all nodes as grid user

          $ find <GRID_HOME>/gpnp/* -type f -exec rm -rf {} \;          

    The profile needs to be cleaned up:

        c1. If root.sh is executed concurrently - one should not execute root.sh on any other nodes before it finishes on first node.

        c2. If network info, location of OCR or Voting Disk etc changed after Grid is installed - rare


Step 3: As root, run $GRID_HOME/root.sh on first node

Step 4: As root, run $GRID_HOME/root.sh on all other node(s), except last one.

Step 5: As root, run $GRID_HOME/root.sh on last node.



D. Grid Infrastructure Deinstall

As grid user, execute "$GRID_HOME/deinstall/deinstall" and follow the instructions, for details, refer to the following documentation for your platform:

Oracle Grid Infrastructure
Installation Guide

How to Modify or Deinstall Oracle Grid Infrastructure

If there's any error, deconfig the failed GI with steps in Section B or C, and deinstall manually with note 1364419.1 



E. OUI Plug-in Failure or OUI Window Closed While Running root.sh

Case applies here is OUI plug-in failure after root.sh has been executed successfully on all nodes or OUI window closed while running root.sh

Identify the cause of failed plug-in. Once root cause is identified and the issue is resolved, refer to note 1360798.1
