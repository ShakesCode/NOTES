UPGRADE TO A CDB DATABASE

UPGRADE PRE-12.1 to 12.1
11g to 12c - upgrade makes it a non-CDB
11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.2+ AND 10.2.0.5 can be upgraded directly
1. Run preupgrd.sql in sqlplus 
2. Run upgrade - perl catctl.pl -n 6 -l $ORACLE_HOME/diagnostics/catupgrd.sql

MIGRATE TO PDB
Must be same endian format
Compatible characterset and national characterset
Same DB options installed

1. Copy option - this will copy files from the source to destination
Shutdown the source DB
create pluggable database DB2
as clone using '/u01/backups/DB1-NonCDB.xml' copy;

2. Move option - this will move the files from old location to new
Shutdown the source DB
create pluggable database DB2
as clone using '/u01/backups/DB1-NonCDB.xml' move;

3. Nocopy option - uses the files of the source DB itself
Shutdown the source DB
create pluggable database DB2
as clone using '/u01/backups/DB1-NonCDB.xml' nocopy tempfile reuse;

CLAUSES (some only)
