--> to install kernel source https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/I_need_the_Kernel_Source

Virtualbox 5.1 GUI is crazy and does not show 'devices' directly.

Need to go to 'preferences' --> virtual machine --> and set up a keyboard shortcut here
Start the VM
Press the keyboard shortcut to mount the guest-additions iso

NOW - the ISO DOES NOT SHOW UP IN /media
  Instead, /dev/cdcom or equivalent should be mounted to a /media/cdrom or such:
  mkdir /media/cdrom
  mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom

yum install gcc
yum install kernel-devel-<kernel number>

export KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86_64
  /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Building the VirtualBox Guest Additions kernel modules
The gcc utility was not found. If the following module compilation fails then
this could be the reason and you should try installing it.

The headers for the current running kernel were not found. If the following
module compilation fails then this could be the reason.
The missing package can be probably installed with
yum install kernel-devel-3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86_64
