GUEST ADDITIONS CDROM NOT MOUNTING

Once you 'insert' the guest-additions iso into 'optical device' it may not sometimes appear as /media/cdrom.
In such cases, do this:

# mkdir /media/cdrom

# mount /dev/cdrom1 /media/cdrom
- OR - 
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom1 /media/cdrom

# cd /media/cdrom
# ls -l
--> Now you should see the stuff there
