GUEST ADDITIONS - MISSING DEVICES MENU

https://superuser.com/questions/893159/cant-install-guest-additions-missing-devices-menu-on-host


- CREATE A KEYBOARD SHORTCUT TO USE TO MOUNT THE GUEST ADDITIONS (you need VirtualBox GUI for this)
Virtualbox 5.1 GUI is crazy and does not show 'devices' links/panes directly.

Need to go to 'preferences' --> virtual machine --> and set up a keyboard shortcut here

- ADD AN OPTICAL DRIVE TO THE MACHINE
In the GUI, in 'storage' add an optical drive - choose ok for 'empty' drive

- MOUNT THE GUEST ADDITIONS ISO TO THE OPTICAL DRIVE 
Start the VM
Press the keyboard shortcut to mount the guest-additions iso

- MOUNT THE OPTICAL DRIVE TO A MOUNT POINT IN THE MACHINE
  Instead, /dev/cdcom or equivalent should be mounted to a /media/cdrom or such:
  mkdir /media/cdrom
  mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
