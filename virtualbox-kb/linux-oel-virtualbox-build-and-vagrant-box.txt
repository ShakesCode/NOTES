System - 
chose manual partitioning,
did not change partition scheme itself -
kept /boot / and swap fs, did not add more
swap was defaulted to 4GB, kept it as is
boot defaulted to 500mb, kept it as is
Changed / and swap to LVM - with new volume group rootvg
Kept /boot as 'standard partition'
File System defaulted to 'xfs' type (except swap which has 'swap' as fs) 
- changed to ext4 to be in the known space though OEL7/RHEL7 defaults to xfs 
(CAUTION - xfs disallows shrinking of f/s - 
but that is ok probably as '/' is going to be the only usable fs for now (than /opt, /apps etc separated)

Click 'start install' -
The next screen starts install, and also shows 'root password' button
--> click root password button and set the root password

Did not add more users to create (like Vagrant...) which can be done later

ERROR - During reboot - failed to insert module autofsf4 (may need guest additions)

In the black non GUI screen, accept license agreement, and choose user creation (seems like user creation is inevitable)
--> then choose quit or continue (cannot remember correctly) to proceed to next GUI steps

Choose language - English India
Choose Keyboard - India with Rupee sign
Choose timezone - Bangalore 
Create user - user1, name user1, password (some)
--> DO NOT click 'setup enterprise logon' --> just click next

NEXT STEPS
Install guest additions
Install oracle preinstall rpm / validation rpm
Install oracleasm modules
Check if open-jdk is good enough (and version) and install Oracle's JDK if that is better
