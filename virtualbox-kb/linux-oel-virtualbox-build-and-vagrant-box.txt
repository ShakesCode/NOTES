System - 
chose manual partitioning,
did not change partition scheme itself -
kept /boot / and swap fs, did not add more
swap was defaulted to 4GB, kept it as is
boot defaulted to 500mb, kept it as is
Changed / and swap to LVM - with new volume group rootvg
Kept /boot as 'standard partition'
File System defaulted to 'xfs' type (except swap which has 'swap' as fs) 
- changed to ext4 to be in the known space though OEL7/RHEL7 defaults to xfs 
(CAUTION - xfs disallows shrinking of f/s - 
but that is ok probably as '/' is going to be the only usable fs for now (than /opt, /apps etc separated)

Click 'start install' -
The next screen starts install, and also shows 'root password' button
--> click root password button and set the root password

Did not add more users to create (like Vagrant...) which can be done later

ERROR - During reboot - failed to insert module autofsf4 (may need guest additions)

In the black non GUI screen, accept license agreement, and choose user creation (seems like user creation is inevitable)
--> then choose quit or continue (cannot remember correctly) to proceed to next GUI steps

Choose language - English India
Choose Keyboard - India with Rupee sign
Choose timezone - Bangalore 
Create user - user1, name user1, password (some)
--> DO NOT click 'setup enterprise logon' --> just click next

NEXT STEPS
 (look after this section for each item details)
Install guest additions

Install oracle preinstall rpm / validation rpm

Install oracleasm modules

Check if open-jdk is good enough (and version) and install Oracle's JDK if that is better

Install guest additions-
Logon as root
Click Devices --> Insert Guest Additions CD Image
- That will mount the ISO that Virtualbox software already has to install guest-additions on the machine
In OEL 7 it pops up a window that says the image is  intended to be automatically started 
--> click  run
It will install the guest-additions software with a black non-gui screen
upon completion, press enter in that screen to exit out of that
--> At this time, mouse integration between host and guest will be active 

Set guest monitor size/resolution-
KDE seemed to max out at 1024x768
xrandr -q also showed the same
However, upon restart of the VM it was fine (probably guest additions install and restart after that fixes it)
After restart, xrandr shows this:
1366x64
1366x664      60.00*+

You can change a few more settings for interaction between host and guest:
- Enable drag and drop between them - from 'Devices --> Drag and Drop'
- Share clipboard (copy-paste) - from 'Devices --> shared clipboard'
