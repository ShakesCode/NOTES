* provider.openstack: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value
--> give the openstack server URL with http/https as appropriate and the port number.  
Version may not be necessary 
- BUT USE VERSION IN THE URL - SO THAT this error can be avoided 
      "You must provide exactly one of DomainID or DomainName to authenticate by Username" in the case using v2.0
--> https://openstack.company.com:5000  or https://openstack.company.com:5000/v2.0

* provider.openstack: You must provide exactly one of DomainID or DomainName in a Scope with ProjectName
Set environment variable OS_PROJECT_NAME=<OPENSTACK PROJECT NAME>

* provider.openstack: You must provide exactly one of DomainID or DomainName to authenticate by Username
--> https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/ --> describes authentication in v2.0 and v3
--> https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/8757

V2 does not need domain-id or domain-name
It can authenticate with username, tenant Id and password are sufficient

* If project ID is required:
Get the project ID for the tenant/project - from access&security --> view credentials
