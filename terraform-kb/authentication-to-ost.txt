OpenStack Provider
The OpenStack provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by OpenStack. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

» Example Usage

# Configure the OpenStack Provider
provider "openstack" {
  user_name   = "admin"
  tenant_name = "admin"
  password    = "pwd"
  auth_url    = "http://myauthurl:5000/v2.0"
  region      = "RegionOne"
}

# Create a web server
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "test-server" {
  # ...
}
» Configuration Reference

The following arguments are supported:

auth_url - (Required) The Identity authentication URL. If omitted, the OS_AUTH_URL environment variable is used.

region - (Optional) The region of the OpenStack cloud to use. If omitted, the OS_REGION_NAME environment variable is used. If OS_REGION_NAME is not set, then no region will be used. It should be possible to omit the region in single-region OpenStack environments, but this behavior may vary depending on the OpenStack environment being used.

user_name - (Optional) The Username to login with. If omitted, the OS_USERNAME environment variable is used.

user_id - (Optional) The User ID to login with. If omitted, the OS_USER_ID environment variable is used.

tenant_id - (Optional) The ID of the Tenant (Identity v2) or Project (Identity v3) to login with. If omitted, the OS_TENANT_ID or OS_PROJECT_ID environment variables are used.

tenant_name - (Optional) The Name of the Tenant (Identity v2) or Project (Identity v3) to login with. If omitted, the OS_TENANT_NAME or OS_PROJECT_NAME environment variable are used.

password - (Optional) The Password to login with. If omitted, the OS_PASSWORD environment variable is used.

token - (Optional; Required if not using user_name and password) A token is an expiring, temporary means of access issued via the Keystone service. By specifying a token, you do not have to specify a username/password combination, since the token was already created by a username/password out of band of Terraform. If omitted, the OS_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable is used.

domain_id - (Optional) The ID of the Domain to scope to (Identity v3). If If omitted, the following environment variables are checked (in this order): OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID, OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID, OS_DOMAIN_ID.

domain_name - (Optional) The Name of the Domain to scope to (Identity v3). If omitted, the following environment variables are checked (in this order): OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME, OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME, OS_DOMAIN_NAME, DEFAULT_DOMAIN.

insecure - (Optional) Trust self-signed SSL certificates. If omitted, the OS_INSECURE environment variable is used.

cacert_file - (Optional) Specify a custom CA certificate when communicating over SSL. You can specify either a path to the file or the contents of the certificate. If omitted, the OS_CACERT environment variable is used.

cert - (Optional) Specify client certificate file for SSL client authentication. You can specify either a path to the file or the contents of the certificate. If omitted the OS_CERT environment variable is used.

key - (Optional) Specify client private key file for SSL client authentication. You can specify either a path to the file or the contents of the key. If omitted the OS_KEY environment variable is used.

endpoint_type - (Optional) Specify which type of endpoint to use from the service catalog. It can be set using the OS_ENDPOINT_TYPE environment variable. If not set, public endpoints is used.

swauth - (Optional) Set to true to authenticate against Swauth, a Swift-native authentication system. If omitted, the OS_SWAUTH environment variable is used. You must also set username to the Swauth/Swift username such as username:project. Set the password to the Swauth/Swift key. Finally, set auth_url as the location of the Swift service. Note that this will only work when used with the OpenStack Object Storage resources.

use_octavia - (Optional) If set to true, API requests will go the Load Balancer service (Octavia) instead of the Networking service (Neutron).
