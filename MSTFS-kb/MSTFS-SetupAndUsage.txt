MSTFS - MICROSOFT TEAM FOUNDATION SERVER - ACCESS AND USAGE

SCOPE
Once accounts are added in TFS and 'path' is created, then how to access it and make use of TFS capabilities.

NOT IN SCOPE: SERVER INSTALL/CONFIG - NOT COVERED IN THIS

SETUP
Obtain access to TFS
Logon to TFS web UI and ensure you can logon
On your laptop, install "Visual Studio Team Explorer"
Note: 'Team explorer' is not the whole Visual Studio suite - it is for accessing TFS.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio)

SETUP IN TEAM EXPLORER (V2010)
Go to Team --> Connect team foundation server
In the next screen, click 'Servers' and add your TFS server name
It will bring in the Team Project Collections and Team Projects (you can view them in TFS web UI also)
Choose the project you want to use and click 'Connect' button

SETUP VIEWS IN TEAM EXPLORER
'View' menu in the main screen has options to view many items like the following:
Team Explorer - ?
Source Control Explorer - shows various branches like main, development, release etc
Solution Explorer - ?
Pending Changes - workspace <workspace name>
Output - ?
Choose each of these and do 'dock as a tabbed document' to make them all appear as tabbed docs for easy access

WORKSPACES (TO BE COMPLETED?)
File --> Source Control --> Workspaces
Add a new workspace
('workspace' is the name for the set of artifacts being developed - like DEPLOYMENTTESTING or ORACLEINSTALL)
Name: ComputerName_<workspace name>  
(Note: computer name comes there by default - remove it to avoid confusion, or keep to know where it is residing))
Server: (pre-filled with tfs server name\collection)
Owner: username of self
Computer: computer name
Permissions:  Private/Public/Public Limted (choose private to begin with)
Comment: Place comment for the workspace
Working Folders:
In working folders, there are two things - 
1. Source Control Folder which is the branch in the TFS project
2. Local folder for a folder on the PC
For 1. choose 'development' folder to begin with.  
For 2. create a local folder like C:/MSTFSWORKSPACES/<path>/DEV/WORKSPACENAME 
(where path is the path created for the team in TFS)
Map workspace - not needed - happens automatically (otherwise, 'file' menu has a way to do it - sometimes that option does not show)

Verify:
Go to 'Source Control Explorer'
Choose the right workspace
Choose project --> path 
It should list Development, Main and Release branches on both sides of the panel i.e. folders and local
Also, it should show Local Path for the Dev branch as created above
Note: it may have not mapped the 'path' level folder yet.  
You can do that by clicking on the path and on the right hand side, 
clicking on the 'not mapped' against local path.  
However, during that, if you have already mapped underlying folders to other workspaces, 
then say 'no' when it asks about consolidating underlying folders.
