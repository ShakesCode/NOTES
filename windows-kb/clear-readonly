Sometimes, your usb drive may become readonly - not sure why. 
So, you cannot copy files on to it then.

To fix:

Open a command prompt
type DISKPART press <enter>
type LIST VOLUME press <enter>
type SELECT VOLUME X, where X is the volume number you want to remove the write protect from. In my case is was Volume 6
type ATTRIBTES DISK CLEAR READONLY press <enter>
you will see a prompt that the write protect has been removed
type EXIT press <enter> Good luck!
