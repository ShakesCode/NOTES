Download an Edge Code build (or Brackets, presumably) on a Windows Vista machine
Run the installer
Result: nothing happens

Expected: installer UI appears

Workarounds:

Right-click > Properties > Unblock. Then run it again.
Move the MSI file to a non-NTFS drive, then run it. (The "downloaded from Internet" tainting metadata is NTFS-only).
I tested on Vista Enterprise edition with default UAC settings, using IE 8. It's possible that other similar setups (e.g. Vista Home or download using Chrome) would not reproduce this.
