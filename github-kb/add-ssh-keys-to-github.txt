=== GENERATE KEYS ====
THIS IS WHAT WORKED FOR ME (while with erroneous keys, Jenkins would hang while accessing Git)
Start git-bash
cd ~  (or cd /c/Users/<username> -->  this is not a necessary step, but convenient

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "gdba@yahoo.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa):
/c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
67:88:54:78:99:1a:cf:4e:c7:22:8c:34:b5:db:78:1d gdba@yahoo.com

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Identity added: /c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa)

$ cd .ssh

$ ls -l
total 4

-rw-r--r--    1 username   Administ      742 Aug 19 18:55 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--    1 username   Administ     2008 Aug 19 18:46 known_hosts

$ cat id_rsa.pub

==== START SSH AGENT ====
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 12356

==== ADD THE KEY TO THE AGENT ==== (is this required?)
$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities.

==== COPY THE KEYS TO GITHUB ====
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Logon to github
In profile choose 'ssh keys' on the left hand side panel
Click 'add ssh key'
Add a comment
Add the copied key 
Save


==== NOW VERIFY ====
