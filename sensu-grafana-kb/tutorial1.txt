Step By Step: Install and Configure Sensu + Grafana
Written by Santhosh Kumar, Cloud Engineer at Powerupcloud. Logesh contributed to Windows client configuration part
We, at Powerupcloud, extensively use Sensu for monitoring the 50+ client environments we manage — which are of all flavors and sizes. Together with Grafana for graphs, we found it to be a great monitoring platform. Though Sensu’s documentation is pretty comprehensive, we did spend some time figuring out things during the initial setup. After multiple deployments of Sensu for wide variety of environments, our engineers grew expertise with it and we thought a clear and concise set of instructions would be useful for someone starting afresh. So what follows is a step by step for -
Sensu Installation and configuration
Uchiwa Dashboard Setup
Configure plugins, sample checks and a sensu client
Graphite and Grafana installation
Rendering Grafana graphs in Uchiwa
Monitoring a windows machine using Sensu
So What is Sensu?
Sensu is a modern open source push based monitoring tool. It’s written in ruby. It is well suited for modern cloud infrastructure which is elastic and dynamic.Sensu messages are passed via rabbitmq message broker. Redis is used to store data. You can use sensu to monitor servers, services, process, application health and business KPI’s. Sensu supports plugins from are nagios, shell scripts, perl, ruby, zabbix, icinga, etc. Sensu is a best replacement for Nagios, if you are running into issues of scale due to pull based natured of Nagios monitoring.
Sensu Architecture
Below is an architecture diagram that depicts how Sensu works

The animation below does a great job of explaining Sensu monitoring flow

Lets now get started with the setup.
Sensu Master Installation
For the sake of simplicity, this guide assumes that you are using an Ubuntu instance to run your Sensu master.
Install the GPG public key
wget -q http://sensu.global.ssl.fastly.net/apt/pubkey.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
Create an APT configuration file at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sensu.list
echo "deb http://sensu.global.ssl.fastly.net/apt sensu main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sensu.list
Update APT and Install Sensu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sensu
Client Configuration Copy the following contents to a configuration file located at /etc/sensu/conf.d/client.json
{
          "client": {
            "name": "sensu-server",
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "environment": "sensu",
            "subscriptions": [ "linux"],
            "keepalive":
            {
           "handler": "mailer",
            "thresholds": {
            "warning": 250,
            "critical": 300
          }
            },
"socket": {
          "bind": "127.0.0.1",
          "port": 3030
            }
          }
}
At minimum, all of the Sensu processes require configuration to tell them how to connect to the configured Sensu Transport.
Copy the following contents to a configuration file located at /etc/sensu/conf.d/transport.json
{
"transport": 
{
"name": "rabbitmq",
"reconnect_on_error": true

           "host": "localhost",
"bind": "0.0.0.0",
         "port": 4567
         }
}

{
"redis": 
{
             "host": "127.0.0.1",
          "port": 6379

Install RabbitMQ
Download the official RabbitMQ 3.6.0 .deb installer package
sudo wget http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v3.6.0/rabbitmq-server_3.6.0-1_all.deb
Install the package using dpkg
sudo dpkg -i rabbitmq-server_3.6.0-1_all.deb
Copy the following contents to a configuration file located at /etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json
{
      "rabbitmq": 
{
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 5672,
        "vhost": "/sensu",
        "user": "sensu",
        "password": "secret"
        }
}

What is Graphite?
Graphite is used to store metrics. It does not provide a facility for collecting metrics. It only receive the metrics from different platform. It’s made up of three major components.
1.Carbon — A high-performance service that listens for time-series data 2. Whisper — A simple database library for storing time-series data
3. Django — Graphite’s user interface & API for rendering graphs and dashboards (web frontend)
Installing Graphite
Install carbon. The default carbon configuration stores only one day. If you need to customize adjust the Retention rates.
apt-get install -y graphite-carbon  
echo "CARBON_CACHE_ENABLED=true" > /etc/default/graphite-carbon  
service carbon-cache start
Install the web frontend
apt-get install -y graphite-web apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi  
chown _graphite /var/lib/graphite  
sudo -u _graphite graphite-manage syncdb --noinput  
rm -f /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf  
cp /usr/share/graphite-web/apache2-graphite.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/graphite.conf  
service apache2 restart
At this point, you can access Graphite dashboard at http://sensuserver-ip-address

What is grafana?
Grafana provides a powerful and easy way to create, explore, and share dashboards. It provides rich graphing experience.
Install Grafana
Install grafana to visualize the metrics. Add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources. list file.
deb https://packagecloud.io/grafana/stable/debian/ jessie main
Then add the Package Cloud key. This allows you to install signed packages.
curl https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add –
Update your Apt repositories and install Grafana
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install grafana
At this point, you can access Grafana dashboard at http://sensuserver-ip-address:3000

Note The default username and password is “admin”, without quotes.
Install WizardVan : A Sensu Metrics Relay
Install git and clone metric relay.
apt-get install -y git  
git clone git://github.com/opower/sensu-metrics-relay.git  
cd sensu-metrics-relay  
cp -R lib/sensu/extensions/* /etc/sensu/extensions
Create /etc/sensu/conf.d/relay.json with the following contents
