Go to ‘Manage Jenkins’ -  ‘Manage Nodes’ – ‘New Node’
Give a node name – ll04-n1
Choose radio button 'dumb slave'
Click next
Give #of executors = 2
Remote fs root = /tmp --> as it is always writeable
Remote directory - /tmp/username/jenkins
Labels - label1
Launch method – Launch slave agents on Unix machines via SSH
Host - hostname of the machine
          Host – localhost ('localhost' if vagrant VM with NAT or actual hostname or IP Address if not NAT) 
          (with vagrant VMs, 'localhost' here, and port 2222 in 'advanced' will enable Jenkins to go to one VM.  
          Not sure how it handles if multiple VMs with same NAT IP are on the same host machine)
Credential - (should give root ideally?) add a new credential of yours with user/pass or certificate (I added user/pass)
Port - 22
Java Path - /oracle/product/12.1.0.2/jdk/bin
Availability - keep this slave up as much as possible

This now shows the node in the manage-node dashboard

Click your node
Click ‘Launch slave agent’ button to install slave software on the node and connect it to Jenkins server
