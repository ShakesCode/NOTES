SECURE THE INSTALLATION
=======================
Reference: http://www.tecmint.com/install-mariadb-in-linux/

This is to change root password, disallow remote root logon, remove anonymous user, remove testdb etc.

To do this:  Run as unix 'root' user the following command and respond to prompts
$ mysql_secure_installation

    #  mysql_secure_installation
    /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation: line 379: find_mysql_client: command not found
    
    NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
          SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!
    
    In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
    password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
    you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
    so you should just press enter here.
    
    Enter current password for root (enter for none):
    
    OK, successfully used password, moving on...
    
    Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
    root user without the proper authorisation.
    
    Set root password? [Y/n] Y
    
    New password:
    Re-enter new password:
    Password updated successfully!
    Reloading privilege tables..
     ... Success!
    
    Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
     ... Success!
    
    Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
    ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.
    
    Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
     ... Success!
    
    By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
    access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
    before moving into a production environment.
    
    Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
     - Dropping test database...
     ... Success!
     - Removing privileges on test database...
     ... Success!
    
    Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
    will take effect immediately.
    
    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
     ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!
