exachk version 12.1.0.2.2 and higher supports virtualization on Exadata.

To perform the complete set of exachk audit checks in an Exadata OVM environment, exachk must be installed in and run from multiple locations, as follows:

From one management domain (dom0)
From one user domain (domU) in each RAC VM cluster
For example, an Oracle Exadata Database Machine quarter rack with 2 database servers containing 4 Oracle RAC VM clusters (2 nodes per cluster for a total of 8 domU's across both database servers) requires running exachk 5 separate times, as follows:

Run exachk in the first user domain (domU) for cluster #1.
Run exachk in the first user domain (domU) for cluster #2.
Run exachk in the first user domain (domU) for cluster #3.
Run exachk in the first user domain (domU) for cluster #4.
Run exachk in the first management domain (dom0).
