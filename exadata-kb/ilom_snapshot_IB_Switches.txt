How to Generate iLOM Snapshot on Infiniband Switches (Doc ID 1594992.1)	To BottomTo Bottom	

APPLIES TO:

Information in this document applies to any platform.
GOAL

Exadata IB NM2 36Port Switches contain an iLOM Daemon that runs within the IB host as opposed to the separate iLOM chipset available on DB and Cell Storage nodes.

When you connect to the iLOM on IB Switches it relies on the iLOM daemon running and you do this as the ilom-admin user.

By Default the iLOM daemon will be running,  if for some reason it is not then you'll need to start this as the root user.




SOLUTION

Confirm ILOM daemon on IB is up

[root@exasw-ib2 ~]# service ilom status
ILOM stack stopped

If its down start it

[root@exasw-ib2 ~]# service ilom start
Stopping any already executing ILOM daemons
Starting event manager
Starting log manager
Starting ILOM IPMI stack
Started ILOM IPMI stack
Starting lumain
Starting luproxy
Starting ealertd
Starting web server
Starting SNMP
 


[root@exasw-ib2 ~]# service ilom status
ILOM stack running


By default the ilom daemon should always be running.
Lets now generate an iLOM snapshot..


Option 1 - Command line interface


[root@exasw-ib2 ~]# su - ilom-admin

Oracle(R) Integrated Lights Out Manager

-> set /X/diag/snapshot dataset=normal
Set 'dataset' to 'normal'


-> set /X/diag/snapshot dump_uri=sftp://root@apactest/tmp
Enter remote user password: ********
Set 'dump_uri' to 'sftp://root@AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD/tmp'
to check the completion of snapshot file transfer:
-> show /SP/diag/snapshot result
 
NOTE: In this example,   We write the log to /tmp on host # apactest with the IP address AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD


OR


Option 2  Web User Interface

From a browser interface connect to the IP# address or the Hostname.

Java needs to be enabled in the browser.

Steps...

- the web ILOM interface at: http://<hostname of switch>
- go to 'Maintenance' tab
- go to 'Snaphost' tab
- Select Data Set=normal & choose preferred Transfer Method
- select 'run'
