There are three plan steps that can indicate possible Smart Scan activity:
(could be others also)

TABLE ACCESS STORAGE FULL
INDEX STORAGE FULL SCAN
INDEX STORAGE FAST FULL SCAN

the word STORAGE only indicates "possibility" of Smart Scan execution
--> without direct-path reads, Smart Scans wonâ€™t be triggered

Direct path read: http://www.dba-oracle.com/m_direct_path_read.htm
- When reading from the TEMP tablespace (a sort operation)
- When reading a parallel full-table scan (parallel query factotum (slave) processes)
- Reading a LOB segment
