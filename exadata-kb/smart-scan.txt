Smart Scans and Offloading
==============================

There are three plan steps that can indicate possible Smart Scan activity:
(could be others also)

TABLE ACCESS STORAGE FULL
INDEX STORAGE FULL SCAN
INDEX STORAGE FAST FULL SCAN

the word STORAGE only indicates "possibility" of Smart Scan execution
--> without direct-path reads, Smart Scans won’t be triggered

One of the enhancements provided by Exadata is the Smart Scan, a mechanism by which parts of a query can be offloaded, or handed off, to the storage servers for processing. This “divide-and-conquer” approach is one reason Exadata is able to provide such stellar performance. It’s accomplished by the configuration of Exadata, where database servers and storage cells offer computing power and the ability to process queries, owing to the unique storage server software running on the storage cells.

Smart Scans

Not every query qualifies for a Smart Scan, as certain conditions must be met. Those conditions are as follows:

A full table scan or full index scan must be used, in addition to direct-path reads.
One or more of the following simple comparison operators must be in use:
=
<
>
>=
=<
BETWEEN
IN
IS NULL
IS NOT NULL
Smart Scans will also be available when queries are run in parallel, because direct-path reads are executed by default, by parallel query slaves. Of course, the other conditions must also be met: parallel only ensures that direct-path reads are used. What does a Smart Scan do to improve performance? It reduces the amount of data the database servers must process to return results. The offloading process divides the workload among the compute nodes and the storage cells, involves more CPU resources, and returns smaller sets of data to the receiving process.

DIRECT PATH READ
=========================
Direct path read: http://www.dba-oracle.com/m_direct_path_read.htm
https://www.perftuning.com/direct-path-reads-oracle-database-11gr2/

- When reading from the TEMP tablespace (a sort operation)
- When reading a parallel full-table scan (parallel query factotum (slave) processes)
- Reading a LOB segment
- NOTE: ?Serial direct path read is available from 11gR2?
