LAB SERVER LIST
Note: 'cl' in the server names are for 'cluster'
mysql5cl1 - 192.168.0.171 - Mgmt Node (also Data Node)
mysql5cl2 - 192.168.0.172 - Data Node (also SQL Node)
mysql5cl3 - 192.168.0.173 - SQL Node

CLUSTER COMPONENTS INFORMATION
Note: The 'mysqld' that comes with cluster-server is different from non-cluster mysqld which installed by the plain mysql-server.  They are not compatible with each other - from cluster-overview.html

Data Nodes (ndbd) - Cluster server software only is needed
              Although this installs all MySQL Cluster binaries, only the program ndbd or ndbmtd (both in /usr/sbin) 
              is actually needed to run a MySQL Cluster data node.
              
SQL Nodes (mysqld - the mysqld with NDB support) - Cluster server AND MySql Client software are needed 
                    This installs the "MySQL server binary (mysqld) with 'NDB storage engine support'" 
                    in the /usr/sbin directory, as well as all needed MySQL Server support files. 
                    It also installs the mysql.server and mysqld_safe startup scripts 
                    (in /usr/share/mysql and /usr/bin, respectively)
                    The mysql client is same as mysql command line tool.

Management Server (ndb_mgmd) - Cluster server software only is needed
                    Although this RPM installs many other files, only the management server binary 
                    ndb_mgmd (in the /usr/sbin directory) is actually required for running a management node. 
                    The server RPM also installs ndb_mgm, the NDB management client.
                
NOTE:  It also says "See Section 2.5.5, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages”, for general information about installing MySQL using RPMs supplied by Oracle. " --> should we then install the mysql server and client (regular non NDB also??)

----------------------
MORE INFO FROM https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-install-linux-rpm.html
----------------------
For a MySQL Cluster, one and possibly two RPMs are required:

The server RPM (for example, MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-7.3.12-1.sles11.i386.rpm or MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-7.4.9-1.sles11.i386.rpm),
which supplies the core files needed to run a MySQL Server with NDBCLUSTER storage engine support (that is, as a MySQL Cluster SQL
node) as well as all MySQL Cluster executables, including the management node, data node, and ndb_mgm client binaries. This RPM is
always required for installing MySQL Cluster.

If you do not have your own client application capable of administering a MySQL server, you should also obtain and install the client
RPM (for example, MySQL-Cluster-client-gpl-7.3.12-1.sles11.i386.rpm or MySQL-Cluster-client-gpl-7.4.9-1.sles11.i386.rpm), which
supplies the mysql client

========
DOWNLOAD
========
It is "MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition"  or  "MySQL CGE"
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/
Download from Oracle's edelivery site
NOTE:
Download only cluster --> One zip file contains Server and Client rpms
  V97582-01.zip MySQL Cluster 7.4.8 RPM for Oracle Linux / RHEL 6 x86 (64bit)

MySQL DB and Cluster are different downloads 
(However, if you choose 'cluster' aka "MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition" and in it "MySQL Database Server",
 then zip files for both cluster and server are displayed in two lists)
(I think the 'database server' is not needed)

-----------------
INSTALL DATA NODE
-----------------
Lab server name: mysql5cl1 (also mgmt node), mysql5cl2 (also sql node)

Creates the following key files:
/usr/sbin/mysqld --> similar, but not the same as regular non-clusterd install mysqld
/usr/sbin/mysqld-debug
/etc/my.cnf
/var/lib/mysql --> the datadir for non-clustered databases
Also installs mysql.server and mysqld_safe startup scripts (in /usr/share/mysql and /usr/bin, respectively)
NOTE: This install of only server does NOT install the 'mysql' client program

[root@mysql5cln1 cluster]# rpm -Uhv --force MySQL-Cluster-server-advanced-7.4.6-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

----------------
INSTALL SQL NODE
----------------
Lab Servers: mysql5cl2 (also data node), mysql5cl3
1. Install cluster server as in the data node install
2. Install mysql client (the mysql executable) using the client installer:
rpm -Uvh --force MySQL-Cluster-client-advanced-7.4.6-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
This installs /usr/sbin/mysql also

-----------------------
INSTALL MANAGEMENT NODE
-----------------------
Lab Server name: mysql5cl1 (also data node)
Install the cluster-server software as done for data node

=====
CONFIGURATION - CAUTION - /ETC/HOSTS LOCALHOST ISSUE
=====
If the hostname is in the lines of 127.0.0.1 or :: lines will disallow connections between nodes.
Therefore, remove the hostname from those lines

=====
CONFIGURATION - CAUTION - NDB-CONNECTSTRING FOR NDBD
=====
ndb-connectstring is necessary for each process - ndbd, ndb_mgmd, mysqld
Just place the following line in my.cnf of data nodes:
[ndb]
ndb-connectstring=management_hostname
(similarly this connect string should be placed under [mysqld] and [mysql_cluster] sections also)

In the Mysql manuals, it is not at all given properly
Need for it is mentioned in this: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-connection-strings.html
There is a confusing reference to it in this: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-config-example.html
  (it is mentioned as connect-string under [ndbd] in my.cnf in this site)
  
This tells the issue clearly: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.html
  To start ndbd, it may also be necessary to specify the host name of the management server and the port on 
  which it is listening. Optionally, one may also specify the node ID that the process is to use.

  shell> ndbd --connect-string="nodeid=2;host=ndb_mgmd.mysql.com:1186"

  See Section 18.3.2.3, “MySQL Cluster Connection Strings”, for additional information about this issue. 
  Section 18.4.27, “Options Common to MySQL Cluster Programs — Options Common to MySQL Cluster Programs”, 
  describes other command-line options which can be used with ndbd. For information about data node 
  configuration parameters, see Section 18.3.2.6, “Defining MySQL Cluster Data Nodes”.

CONFIGURE DATA NODE  (do this on each data node)
-------------------
Edit /etc/hosts to reflect all mgmt and data nodes
Create folder /var/lib/mysql-cluster 
Create folder /var/lib/mysql-cluster/data

This node does not need a config.ini similar to management server.
Instead, edit /etc/my.cnf as follows:
  NOTE: Save a copy of initial/current my.cnf for safety
  
For all parameters: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-params-ndbd.html

  [ndbd]

  [mysqld]
  ndbcluster  # run NDB storage engine, not the other one
  ndb-connectstring=mysql5cl1  # location of management server

  [mysql_cluster]
  ndb-connectstring=mysql5cl1  # location of management server

Start 'ndb' on data node
------------------------
$ /usr/sbin/ndbd
OR
$ /usr/sbin/ndbd --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf

(for checking what parameters it is using and precedence of my.cnf run "ndbd --help")

This initially may error saying it needs directory /usr/local/mysql/data
-->To use your own data directory like /var/lib/mysql-cluster/data --> ensure it is mentioned so in config.ini in management node. Otherwise, create that /usr/local/mysql/data directory as root - which I do not prefer to do.

It show now start and connect to management server:

Logfile will be in /usr/local/mysql/data/ndb_2_out.log

Verify:
------
On the mangagement server node run ndb_mgm show.
Ensure hostnames are as you wanted
IP's may for now show localhost IP 127.0.0.1 instead of real IP

$ ndb_mgm
ndb_mgm> show
[root@mysql5cl1 mysql-cluster]# ndb_mgm
-- NDB Cluster -- Management Client --
ndb_mgm> show
Connected to Management Server at: mysql5cl1:1186
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]	2 node(s)
id=2	@127.0.0.1  (mysql-5.6.24 ndb-7.4.6, starting, Nodegroup: 0)
id=3 (not connected, accepting connect from mysql5cl2)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)]	1 node(s)
id=1	@127.0.0.1  (mysql-5.6.24 ndb-7.4.6)

[mysqld(API)]	2 node(s)
id=4 (not connected, accepting connect from mysql5cl2)
id=5 (not connected, accepting connect from mysql5cl3)

ndb_mgm> 

------------------
CONFIGURE SQL NODE
------------------
Edit /etc/hosts to reflect all mgmt and data nodes
This node does not need a config.ini similar to management server.

Instead, edit /etc/my.cnf as follows:
NOTE: Save a copy of initial/current my.cnf for safety

  # This ndbd line is necessary if this node is data node also
  [ndbd]
  ndb-connectstring=mysql5cl1
 
  # Following mysqld and mysql_cluster sections are necessary for SQL nodes
  [mysqld]
  ndbcluster  # run NDB storage engine, not the other one
  ndb-connectstring=mysql5cl1
  
  [mysql_cluster]
  ndb-connectstring=mysql5cl1  # location of management server

NOTE: Other files/folders to know
/var/lib/mysql 
/var/lib/mysql/host.err --> mysqld_safe logs to this file
/var/lib/mysql/host.pid --> pid of mysqld process
/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock --> socket/lock file

/var/log/mysql.log 
/var/run/mysqld

Start 'mysqld' daemon with the startup script as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------
Use - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysqld-safe.html. 
--> These specifics are not there in the cluster config instructions.

$ /etc/init.d/mysql start  (this script calls mysqld_safe internally. It is also the rc script)
OR
$ mysqld_safe  (which is in /usr/bin)

This will start mysqld daemon and exit

Verify:
------
On SQL node:  ps -ef |grep mysqld

On Management Node: 
$ ndb_mgm
ndb_mgm> show

<< TBD - Initially THIS DID NOT SHOW THAT SQL NODE IS CONNECTING - NEED TO DEBUG WHY >>
<<  HOWEVER, IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF 127.0.0.1 LINE CONTAINING THE HOSTNAME. UPON HOSTNAME REMOVAL, IT WORKED>>

TODO
================
PARTIAL CLUSTER START:
In the initial startup, it waits until all data nodes are up --> ndb_mgm show shows 'waiting' status continuously
until all data nodes are up.  
Question: What if we just want to start only one data node to begin with?
