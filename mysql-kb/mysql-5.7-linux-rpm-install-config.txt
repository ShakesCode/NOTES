============================================
SECURE THE INSTALLATION - CHANGE ROOT PW ETC
============================================
MySql sets an initial root password and logs it in /var/log/mysqld.log.
(awk it as follows: 
# awk '/localhost:/{print $NF}' /var/log/mysqld.log
&Md;9D.&%oSz --> this is the password
)
It has to be changed after installation.
Also, some other restrictions must be placed.

Here are the steps (manual): For automated steps, see the kb file on secure-installation-rpm
------------------
- Get the initial root password
root@cbmysqlr1:~# grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log                       
2016-05-11T13:33:57.878206Z 1 [Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: &Md;9D.&%oSz  

- Start the secure installation process
root@cbmysqlr1:~# mysql_secure_installation                             
Securing the MySQL server deployment.                       
Enter password for user root:   --> This needs to be complex with upper and lower cases, special characters and numerics  
New password:                          
Re-enter new password:                          
Estimated strength of the password: 100   
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y 

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,         
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have  
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.  
You should remove them before moving into a production    
environment.                  
Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y 
Success.                                                                                                                                                     
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from    
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at  
the root password from the network.                            
Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y   
Success.                                                                                                                                                     
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that   
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,  
and should be removed before moving into a production     
environment.                                 
Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y      
 - Dropping test database...      
Success.                          
 - Removing privileges on test database...    
Success.   

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes    
made so far will take effect immediately.   
Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y    
Success.                          
All done!

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11445678/binary-log-error-in-mysql


Setup required:
Directories to be used should be owned by mysql:mysql
In my.cnf - Mandatory - server-id (surely), log-bin-index (also possibly)

----------------
my.cnf additions:
----------------
# Server Id (mandatory if setting binlog)
server-id=1

# additional lines for [mysqld]
log-bin=/mysqldata/mysql/binlog/binlog
log-bin-index=/mysqldata/mysql/binlog/binlog.index
expire_logs_days=2
binlog_format=mixed

----------------------
BINLOG TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------
NOTE: server-id value in my.cnf is mandatory to enable binlog. Otherwise, service mysqld start will fail.
        This error is not obvious in the screen messages immediately.
        After the failure, run the command "journalctl -xe" which shows extended messages that state 
        "You have enabled the binary log, but you haven't provided the mandatory server-id"
        (see full listing below)
        
NOTE: /var/log/mysqld.log shows binlog index file is not there:
mysqld: File '/data/mysql/binlog/binlog.index' not found (Errcode: 13 - Permission denied)

root@cbmysqlr1:~# service mysqld start
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start  mysqld.service
Job for mysqld.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status mysqld.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

DATADIR - CHANGE LOCATION
============================
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795176/how-to-change-mysql-data-directory
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/multiple-data-directories.html

-----------------------------
Stop the daemon
-----------------------------
# service mysqld stop

-----------------------------------
Move the contents of default folder
-----------------------------------
Copy contents of default location /var/lib/mysql (including subdirectories) into other folder like /mysqldata/mysql/data.
NOTE: The 'socket' file for this instance of MySQL is also in this directory while mysqld is running.

-----------------------------
Modify /etc/my.cnf as follows
-----------------------------
In [mysqld] comment out the old datadir and socket, and add the new locations
  #datadir=/var/lib/mysql
  #socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
  datadir=/mysqldata/mysql/data
  socket=/mysqldata/mysql/data/mysql.sock

In [client] section add the same socket as the socket for [mysqld].
  [client]
  socket=/mysqldata/mysql/data/mysql.sock

  Otherwise, you will get the following error while connecting:
    root@cbmysqlr1:/mysqldata/mysql/data# mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:
    ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2)
    
-----------------------------
Restart the daemon
-----------------------------
# service mysqld start

=========================================
CREATING DATABASES IN NON-DEFAULT FOLDERS
=========================================
Databases get created under 'datadir'/<dbname> - like /var/lib/mysql/hr.

------------------
Existing Databases
------------------
Stop mysqld daemon - service mysqld stop.
Move the <dbname> folder off to desired location - like /mysqldata/mysql/db/hr.
Make soft link to the new folder in the default location:
  cd /var/lib/mysql
  ln -s /mysqldata/mysql/db/hr
Start mysqld daemon - service mysqld start.
