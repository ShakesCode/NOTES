                  MYSQL ON WINDOWS
========================================================

NOTE ON PATH:
After installation with the instructions here, PATH will have MySQL bin directories in it.
However, later on, if we try to extend the PATH by doing 'set PATH=%PATH%:C:\opt\xxx\bin' and such
a peculiar thing happens - apparently mysql gets called and it produces much error messages -
FINALLY, the intended path (and subsequent environment setup if using a env.bat like file)
do not get set.

Therefore, remove the mysql directories from path.

Paths with Mysql in them:
C:\>set path
Path='C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;
C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Application Virtualization Client;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Fabric 1.5

Z:\>set path
Path=C:\Opt\Chef-Toolchain-G1\chefdk\bin;C:\Opt\Chef-Toolchain-G1\chefdk\embedded\bin;\gemhome\gem\ruby\2.1.0\bin;;;;

MY.INI
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html
C:\WINDOWS is the default location (when you start mysqld without any init-file or defaults-file parameter, this will be used)
Copy the MY.INI file from C:\programdata\mysql to C:\WINDOWS

To find the defaults-file lookup order, run 'mysqladmin' and its output see this:
Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
	C:\WINDOWS\my.ini C:\WINDOWS\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf 
	C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.ini 
	C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.cnf

NON-ADMIN PERMISSIONS
Set permissions on C:\Programdata\Mysql and C:\windows\my.ini so that a non-admin can write to them

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================
READ THIS FULLY
---------------

This C:\MYSQL is created by me
So are C:\MYSQL-Data and C:\MYSQL-Logs

----
----
STARTUP PROBLEMS: (as non-windows-service)

MySQL, during startup tries to write to 'basedir' - defaults to Install-Dir - "C:\Program Files\MySQL...."
MYSQL also looks for Data folder under basedir
But, "C:\Program Files" is not writeable (at least for non-admins)

----
----
MYSQL should take 'basedir' from one of the my.ini - in C:\WINDOWS (???or "C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7" ???)
But it was not taking the programdata...\my.ini file though basedir was changed to programdata...


Initially:
	There is no my.ini in C:\WINDOWS
	And, my.ini in C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7 does not have a basedir set (and mysqld was not looking at it anyway)

----
----
Created this directory C:\MYSQL
Created my.ini in it
Mentioned in it basedir as "C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7"

Created another file my.ini in C:\WINDOWS
Referenced C:\MYSQL\my.ini in it as 
	!include C:\MYSQL\my.ini

----
----
Further, as admin, made C:\ProgramData\MYSQL writeable by all users (not just admins)
And, made C:\WINDOWS\my.ini writeable by all users (not just admins)

----
----
After all this, starting mysql using 'mysqld' on command line is working - it is taking C:\WINDOWS\my.ini

----
----
Also created an empty my.cnf in C:\WINDOWS just in case it is needed for any reason
