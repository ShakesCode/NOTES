CONVERT ECLIPSE JAVA PROJECT TO MAVEN

Right-click on the project in the project browser
Go to configure --> convert to maven project
In the pop-up window provide the following:
Project - /HR - leave it as it is
Group ID - HR - left  it as it is
Artifact ID - HR - left it as it is
Verions - 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT - left it as it is
Packagin - jar (used jar, other options war and pom)
Name - HR-Maven (was blank)
Description - HR-Maven - converted from Java Project (was blank)
Click 'Finish'

It then creates a pom.xml in the folder "C:\Data\HOME-TECH\DEV-SPACE\Java\Eclipse\HR"
Where HR is the root of the project, under which src and bin directories were created by Eclipse

Now, you can update the Gihub repository with this additional stuff (see other document for that step)
